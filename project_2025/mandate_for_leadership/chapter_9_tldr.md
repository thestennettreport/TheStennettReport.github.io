title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 9 - Agency for International Development - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 9](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_9.pdf) outlines a plan to transform USAID into a tool for advancing a conservative ideological agenda, prioritizing the fight against China and the promotion of conservative values over humanitarian needs and development goals.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **"Deradicalizing" USAID:** The chapter calls for "deradicalizing" USAID by eliminating programs related to abortion, climate change, and gender equality, arguing that these are "divisive" and "harmful" and reflect a "woke" agenda.
* **Countering China:** It emphasizes the need to counter China's influence in the developing world, framing China's development model as "authoritarian" and "exploitative."
* **Promoting Conservative Values:**  It advocates for using USAID to promote conservative social values, such as opposition to abortion and support for traditional families, turning foreign aid into a tool for ideological advancement.
* **Reducing Foreign Aid:** It calls for scaling back USAID's global footprint and cutting its budget, reflecting a broader conservative skepticism towards foreign aid and a desire to reduce government spending.
* **Empowering Faith-Based Organizations:** It advocates for increasing funding to faith-based organizations, suggesting they are more effective than secular organizations in providing development assistance.

**Critical Quote:**

"The Biden Administration has deformed the agency [USAID] by treating it as a global platform to pursue overseas a divisive political and cultural agenda that promotes abortion, climate extremism, gender radicalism, and interventions against perceived systematic racism."

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a plan to use USAID to advance a narrow ideological agenda, potentially undermining its effectiveness in promoting development, harming vulnerable populations, and damaging America's relationships with developing countries.

**Red Flags:**

* **Harm to Vulnerable Populations:**  Cutting foreign aid and shifting priorities could harm those who rely on U.S. assistance for essential services like healthcare, education, and disaster relief.
* **Erosion of Human Rights:**  Eliminating programs related to reproductive health, gender equality, and climate change would undermine efforts to promote human rights and address global challenges.
* **Religious Discrimination:**  Increasing funding to faith-based organizations could lead to discrimination against beneficiaries who do not share their religious beliefs.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 9](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_9.pdf) outlines a dangerous shift in U.S. foreign aid policy, prioritizing ideology over humanitarian needs and potentially turning USAID into a tool for promoting a narrow conservative agenda at the expense of those it is supposed to help.
