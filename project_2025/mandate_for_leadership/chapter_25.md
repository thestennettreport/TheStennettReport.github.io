**[Chapter 25: Small Business Administration](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_25.pdf)**

**Author:** Karen Kerrigan, President and CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Small Business Administration (SBA), arguing that it has become a "sprawling, unaccountable agency" plagued by "waste, fraud, and mismanagement." Kerrigan criticizes the agency's "mission creep" and its focus on "inclusivity" initiatives that she believes are actually creating "exclusivity." She outlines a plan to reform the SBA, making it more accountable, efficient, and focused on its core mission of supporting entrepreneurship and small business growth.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Shrinking the SBA:** Kerrigan advocates for a "tighter, more focused SBA" that concentrates on its core functions of providing access to capital, entrepreneurial development, and government contracting support. She suggests that some programs should be eliminated or consolidated and that the agency's budget should be reduced.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a decrease in support for small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities, and could make it more difficult for entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses.
* **Ending Direct Lending:** Kerrigan calls for an end to SBA direct lending, arguing that it is inefficient and susceptible to fraud. She prefers that the SBA focus on guaranteeing loans made by private lenders.
    * **Concern:** This could make it more difficult for small businesses, particularly those in underserved communities, to access capital, as private lenders may be less willing to lend to them without the backing of the SBA.
* **Strengthening the Office of Advocacy:** Kerrigan praises the Office of Advocacy, which is responsible for representing the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process, and calls for increasing its budget and authority.
    * **Concern:** While a strong Office of Advocacy is important for ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden small businesses, a more powerful Advocacy office could also be used to weaken regulations that protect consumers, workers, and the environment.
* **Accountability and Transparency:** Kerrigan emphasizes the need for greater accountability and transparency at the SBA, calling for stricter performance metrics, more rigorous oversight, and a full accounting of COVID-19 relief program spending.
    * **Concern:** While accountability and transparency are important, this could also be used to justify cuts to SBA programs and to increase privatization.
* **Criticism of "Inclusivity" Initiatives:** Kerrigan criticizes the SBA's focus on "inclusivity" initiatives, arguing that they are actually creating "exclusivity" and are not reaching all eligible small businesses.
    * **Concern:** This suggests a disregard for the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship and could lead to a decrease in support for minority-owned and women-owned businesses.

**Summary:**

Chapter 25 outlines a conservative vision for the SBA that prioritizes efficiency, accountability, and a reduced role for government in supporting small businesses. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a decrease in funding for SBA programs, a greater reliance on private lenders, and a weakening of efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less supportive and less equitable environment for small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Reduced Support for Small Businesses:** The proposals to shrink the SBA, end direct lending, and focus on core functions could lead to a decrease in overall support for small businesses, making it more difficult for entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses.
* **Harm to Underserved Communities:** The elimination of direct lending and the emphasis on private lenders could make it more difficult for small businesses in underserved communities to access capital, potentially exacerbating existing economic disparities.
* **Weakening of Regulations:** A more powerful Office of Advocacy could be used to weaken regulations that protect consumers, workers, and the environment, potentially harming the public interest.
* **Decreased Focus on Diversity and Inclusion:** The criticism of "inclusivity" initiatives suggests a disregard for the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship and could lead to a decrease in support for minority-owned and women-owned businesses.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, reflects the conservative agenda to reduce the role of the federal government in supporting economic development and promoting social equity. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the vitality of the small business sector, which is a major engine of job creation and economic growth, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less dynamic and less inclusive economy under a future conservative administration.
