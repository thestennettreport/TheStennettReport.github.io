title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 18
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Labor and Related Agencies](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_18.pdf)

**Author:** Jonathan Berry, Former Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy at the U.S. Department of Labor

Chapter 18 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Labor (DOL) and related agencies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Authored by Jonathan Berry, a former Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy at the DOL under President Trump, the chapter argues that the Biden Administration has pursued a radical "left-wing social-engineering agenda" that undermines American workers and families. Berry outlines a conservative vision for labor policy that prioritizes "family-supporting jobs," worker independence, and a reduced role for government in labor markets.

The chapter's significance lies in its comprehensive plan to reshape labor policy in a way that weakens worker protections, undermines unions, and promotes a conservative social agenda. Berry's recommendations could lead to a decline in wages and benefits, a weakening of workplace safety standards, and increased discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and other marginalized groups. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less worker-friendly labor market under a future conservative administration.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Restoring the "Family-Supporting Job":** Berry emphasizes the need to restore the "family-supporting job" as the centerpiece of the American economy, suggesting that current labor policies are undermining families and traditional values. This rhetoric could be used to justify policies that weaken worker protections, reduce wages, and make it more difficult for families to make ends meet.
* **Reversing the "DEI Revolution":** Berry criticizes the "DEI revolution" in labor policy, arguing that it has led to discrimination against conservative and religious viewpoints and has imposed burdensome regulations on businesses. He calls for eliminating DEI initiatives, restricting the application of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, and refocusing enforcement of sex discrimination laws on the "biological binary meaning of 'sex.'" This would undermine efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace and could lead to discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and other marginalized groups.
* **Promoting "Pro-Life" Measures:** Berry advocates for "pro-life workplace accommodations for mothers," including requiring employers to provide equal or greater benefits for pregnancy and adoption as they do for abortion. He also calls for clarifying that ERISA does not preempt state laws restricting abortion. This would impose a conservative religious agenda on businesses and could restrict access to reproductive health care for women.
* **Protecting Religious Employers:** Berry calls for providing "robust protections for religious employers," arguing that they should be free to run their businesses according to their religious beliefs, even if those beliefs conflict with anti-discrimination laws. This could allow religious employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals and other groups based on their religious beliefs.
* **Expanding Independent Contractor Status:** Berry advocates for protecting "flexible work options and worker independence," including making it easier for businesses to classify workers as independent contractors. This could erode worker protections and benefits, making it easier for businesses to exploit workers and avoid paying for unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, and other benefits.
* **Weakening Unions:** Berry supports reforms that would weaken unions, including the Teamwork for Employees and Managers (TEAM) Act, which would allow for the creation of non-union "employee involvement organizations." He also calls for increasing union transparency and restricting the scope of "protected concerted activity." This would undermine the ability of workers to organize and bargain collectively for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.

* **Project 2025, Chapter 3:**  This chapter, focusing on central personnel agencies, complements Chapter 18 by advocating for weakening civil service protections and making it easier to fire federal employees, potentially allowing for a purge of DOL employees who support worker rights or unions.
* **Project 2025, Chapter 11:**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Education, supports Chapter 18 by calling for a rollback of federal regulations related to sex education and transgender students, aligning with the conservative social agenda promoted in both chapters.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS
