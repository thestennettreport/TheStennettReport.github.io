### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Forward: A Promise To America](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/foreward.pdf)

**Author:** Kevin D. Roberts, PhD, President of The Heritage Foundation

The Foreword of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership," penned by Kevin D. Roberts, President of The Heritage Foundation, serves as a rallying cry for conservatives, urging them to embrace the project as a blueprint for a conservative revolution in government. Roberts draws parallels between the current political climate and that of the late 1970s, arguing that America is once again facing a crisis of confidence and that only a bold conservative agenda can restore the nation's greatness. He outlines four key promises that form the core of this agenda: restoring the family, dismantling the administrative state, defending national sovereignty, and securing individual liberty.

The Foreword's significance lies in its framing of Project 2025 as a response to a perceived national crisis and its articulation of a clear conservative vision for America. It sets the stage for the rest of the book, highlighting the urgency and importance of the project's recommendations. Roberts's rhetoric is likely to resonate with conservatives who share his belief that America is on the wrong track and that a radical change in direction is needed. However, his alarmist tone and his portrayal of a nation in peril are likely to raise concerns among Democrats and those who do not share his conservative worldview.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **America in Crisis:** Roberts paints a bleak picture of America, arguing that the nation is facing a crisis of confidence similar to that of the late 1970s, marked by economic stagnation, social unrest, and a loss of faith in government.
* **Conservative Solutions:** He presents conservatism as the solution to America's problems, arguing that conservative principles of limited government, free markets, and individual responsibility are the only way to restore prosperity, security, and national greatness.
* **The "Administrative State" as the Enemy:** Roberts identifies the "administrative state" as the primary obstacle to progress, arguing that it is a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy that stifles innovation, undermines freedom, and imposes a liberal agenda on the American people.
* **The Importance of "Day One" Readiness:** He emphasizes the need for conservatives to be ready to implement their agenda on "Day One" of a new administration, arguing that they cannot afford to waste time or to compromise with their opponents.
* **A Call to Action:** The Foreword concludes with a call to action, urging conservatives to unite behind Project 2025 and to work tirelessly to elect a conservative President who will implement its recommendations.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 America in Crisis <sup>(34)</sup>**

* Roberts begins by comparing the current state of America to the late 1970s, a time of economic and social turmoil. He argues that the nation is once again facing significant challenges, including a discredited political class, a raging culture war, and the rise of China as a global threat.
* **Quote:** "Today, America and the conservative movement are enduring an era of division and danger akin to the late 1970s."

**3.2 The Conservative Promise <sup>(35)</sup>**

* Roberts outlines four key promises that form the core of the conservative agenda:
    * **Promise #1: Restore the Family:**  This promise emphasizes the importance of strengthening the American family and protecting children. It calls for policies that promote marriage, parental rights, and a culture of life. It also advocates for confronting threats to family stability, such as those posed by Big Tech and pornography. <sup>(37)</sup>
        * **Quote:** "The next conservative President must get to work pursuing the true priority of politics—the well-being of the American family."
    * **Promise #2: Dismantle the Administrative State:** This promise focuses on reducing the size and scope of the federal government and returning power to the American people. It calls for restoring constitutional accountability, reining in the bureaucracy, and ending the "Administrative State." <sup>(40)</sup>
        * **Quote:** "The surest way to put the federal government back to work for the American people is to reduce its size and scope back to something resembling the original constitutional intent."
    * **Promise #3: Defend National Sovereignty:** This promise emphasizes the need to protect America's sovereignty, borders, and resources from global threats. It calls for ending illegal immigration, securing the border, decoupling from China, and achieving energy dominance. <sup>(43)</sup>
        * **Quote:** "The United States belongs to 'We the people.' All government authority derives from the consent of the people, and our nation's success derives from the character of its people."
    * **Promise #4: Secure Individual Liberty:** This promise focuses on protecting individual rights and freedoms, including economic freedom, religious freedom, and freedom of speech. It calls for promoting free enterprise, limiting government intervention, and defending the Constitution. <sup>(47)</sup>
        * **Quote:** "The American Republic was founded on principles prioritizing and maximizing individuals' rights to live their best life or to enjoy what the Framers called 'the Blessings of Liberty.'"

**3.3 "Mandate for Leadership": A Blueprint for Action <sup>(35)</sup>**

* Roberts highlights the legacy of the original "Mandate for Leadership" published in 1981, which provided a blueprint for the Reagan Revolution. He argues that this new "Mandate for Leadership" will similarly equip the next conservative President with a bold and courageous plan to restore America's greatness.
* **Quote:** "This book is the product of more than 400 scholars and policy experts from across the conservative movement and around the country. This is an agenda prepared by and for conservatives who will be ready on Day One of the next Administration to save our country from the brink of disaster."

**3.4 A Call to Action <sup>(49)</sup>**

* Roberts concludes by urging conservatives to unite behind Project 2025 and to work tirelessly to elect a conservative President who will implement its recommendations.
* He calls for a "new generation of conservative leaders" who are "bold, courageous, and committed to the principles that made America great."

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

The Foreword of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" serves as a call to action for conservatives, urging them to unite behind a bold agenda that prioritizes the family, individual liberty, national sovereignty, and constitutional governance. It argues that Project 2025 provides the blueprint for this agenda and will equip the next conservative President with the tools and policies necessary to restore America's greatness. 

The Foreword sets the stage for the rest of the book, framing Project 2025 as a response to a perceived national crisis and articulating a clear conservative vision for America. While its rhetoric is likely to resonate with conservatives who share its worldview, it also raises concerns among Democrats and others who do not share its conservative ideology about the potential for a more divisive, less inclusive, and less democratic America under a future conservative administration.
