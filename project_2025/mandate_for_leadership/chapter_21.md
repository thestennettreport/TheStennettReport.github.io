title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 21 - Department of Commerce
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Commerce](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_21.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_21_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Thomas F. Gilman, Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Administration

Chapter 21 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Commerce, arguing that it has become bloated, inefficient, and captured by career bureaucrats who are resistant to implementing conservative policies. Authored by Thomas F. Gilman, a former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Administration under President Trump, the chapter emphasizes the need for strong political leadership to reorient the department towards promoting economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness, particularly in the face of challenges from China. Gilman outlines a plan to streamline the department, strengthen its enforcement capabilities, and make it more responsive to the needs of American businesses, often at the expense of consumer protections and environmental regulations.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a more politicized and less independent Department of Commerce, with a greater focus on promoting American business interests and a weaker commitment to protecting consumers, workers, and the environment. Gilman's recommendations could lead to a rollback of regulations, a weakening of enforcement against corporate misconduct, and a prioritization of economic growth over other national priorities. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for corporate capture of the department, a decline in the quality of government services, and a less equitable and less sustainable economy.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Strong Political Control:** Gilman stresses the need for strong political leadership at the Department of Commerce, arguing that career staff have too much influence and are resistant to change. This suggests a desire to politicize the department and to prioritize loyalty over expertise and experience.
* **Countering China:** Gilman identifies China as a major economic and national security threat and calls for the department to play a more active role in countering Chinese "malign influence," including through trade enforcement, export controls, and investment restrictions. This reflects a broader conservative focus on confronting China and decoupling the U.S. economy from China's.
* **Streamlining and Efficiency:** The chapter emphasizes the need to streamline the department's operations, reduce bureaucracy, and eliminate "wasteful" programs. This reflects a broader conservative preference for smaller government and a belief that the private sector is more efficient than the government.
* **Deregulation and Business-Friendly Policies:** Gilman advocates for a more business-friendly approach to regulation, suggesting that the department should focus on reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and promoting economic growth. This could lead to a weakening of consumer protections, environmental regulations, and other safeguards.
* **"America First" Economic Nationalism:** The chapter reflects an "America First" approach to economic policy, prioritizing the interests of American businesses and workers over global cooperation or free trade.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 21 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for the Department of Commerce that prioritizes strong political control, a confrontational approach to China, deregulation, and a focus on promoting American business interests. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a more politicized and less effective department, with a weaker commitment to protecting consumers, the environment, and the integrity of the Census. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for abuses of power, a decline in the quality of government services, and a less equitable and less sustainable economy.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reinforces the pattern of "Project 2025" to reduce the role of the federal government in regulating the economy, protecting the environment, and ensuring fair and accurate data collection. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the competitiveness of the U.S. economy, the health of our planet, and the fairness of our democracy, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less sustainable future under a future conservative administration.
