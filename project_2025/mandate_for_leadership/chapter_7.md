title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 7 - Intelligence Community
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Intelligence Community](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_7.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_7_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Dustin J. Carmack, Former Chief of Staff for the Director of National Intelligence

Chapter 7 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the network of 18 agencies responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to policymakers. Authored by Dustin J. Carmack, former Chief of Staff for the Director of National Intelligence under President Trump, the chapter argues that the IC has become too bureaucratic, risk-averse, and influenced by "woke" ideology. Carmack outlines a plan to reform the IC, making it more responsive to the President's priorities, more aggressive in countering threats, particularly from China, and less concerned with political correctness and civil liberties.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a more politicized and less independent IC, with a greater emphasis on national security and a weaker commitment to protecting privacy and civil liberties. This approach raises serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for abuses of power, a chilling effect on dissent within the intelligence community, and a weakening of oversight and accountability.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Politicization of Intelligence:** Carmack emphasizes the need for the IC to be aligned with the President's priorities and to support his agenda, suggesting a willingness to subordinate objective intelligence analysis to political considerations.
* **Strengthening Executive Control:** The chapter advocates for strengthening the authority of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to lead and direct the IC, potentially concentrating power in the hands of a single individual and reducing the independence of individual agencies.
* **Focus on China:** Carmack identifies China as the primary strategic threat and calls for refocusing the IC's resources and priorities on countering Chinese espionage, technological advancements, and influence operations.
* **Expanding Surveillance Powers:** The chapter advocates for amending Executive Order 12333 to expand the IC's surveillance powers, particularly in cyberspace, raising concerns about potential violations of privacy and civil liberties.
* **Rejection of "Woke" Culture:** Carmack echoes the criticism of "woke" culture found throughout Project 2025, arguing that it is weakening the IC and undermining morale. He calls for eliminating programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and for promoting a more conservative culture within the intelligence community.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 7 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a plan to reform the Intelligence Community, making it more responsive to the President's priorities and more aggressive in countering perceived threats, particularly from China. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a more politicized and less independent IC, with expanded surveillance powers and a weaker commitment to protecting civil liberties. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for abuses of power and a further erosion of privacy and freedom.

This chapter, along with Chapters [4](./chapter_4.md) and [6](./chapter_6.md), paints a picture of a future conservative administration that is more focused on national security, more willing to use the power of the government to achieve its goals, and less concerned about protecting civil liberties and democratic norms. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the balance of power between the executive branch and other branches of government, as well as on the rights and freedoms of American citizens.
