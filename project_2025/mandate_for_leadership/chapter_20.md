title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 20 - Department of Veterans Affairs
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Veterans Affairs](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_20.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_20_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Brooks D. Tucker, Former Acting Chief of Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs

Chapter 20 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the agency responsible for providing healthcare and benefits to America's veterans. Authored by Brooks D. Tucker, a former Acting Chief of Staff at the VA during the Trump administration, the chapter argues that while the VA has made progress in becoming more "Veteran-centric," it remains plagued by bureaucracy, inefficiency, and a "culture of complacency." Tucker outlines a plan to reform the VA, emphasizing accountability, efficiency, expanded access to private healthcare through community care, and a reduction in the agency's role in directly providing services.

The chapter's significance lies in its vision for a smaller, less active VA, with a greater reliance on the private sector to deliver healthcare and benefits to veterans. While presented as a way to improve efficiency and empower veterans with choice, this approach raises serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for privatization to undermine the quality of care, increase costs for veterans, and weaken the VA's ability to provide specialized services tailored to veterans' unique needs.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **"Veteran-Centric" Approach:** Tucker emphasizes the need for a "Veteran-centric" approach, arguing that the VA should prioritize the needs of veterans over the interests of the bureaucracy. This rhetoric, while appealing, could be used to justify cuts to VA programs and services, privatization of VA healthcare, and a weakening of protections for VA employees.
* **Expanding Community Care:** The chapter strongly advocates for expanding access to community care, allowing veterans to receive healthcare from private providers outside the VA system. This aligns with the broader conservative preference for market-based solutions and a reduced role for government in healthcare.
* **Streamlining and Efficiency:** Tucker focuses on streamlining the VA's operations, reducing bureaucracy, and improving efficiency. This reflects a broader conservative emphasis on smaller government and a belief that the private sector is more efficient than the government.
* **Accountability and Oversight:** The chapter calls for greater accountability and oversight of the VA, including conducting independent audits, strengthening performance metrics, and improving IT systems. While accountability is important, this could also be used to justify cuts to VA programs and to increase privatization.
* **Addressing Shifting Demographics:** Tucker acknowledges the challenges posed by shifting veteran demographics, including an aging population and a growing number of women veterans. However, his proposed solutions focus primarily on expanding community care and streamlining services, rather than on investing in the VA's capacity to meet these evolving needs.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on a "Veteran-centric" approach, expanding community care, and promoting conservative social values aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 3](./chapter_3.md):**  This chapter, focusing on central personnel agencies, complements Chapter 20 by advocating for weakening civil service protections, making it easier to fire VA employees who are not aligned with the President's agenda.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 14](./chapter_14.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Health and Human Services, supports Chapter 20 by advocating for a more market-based approach to healthcare and for reducing the role of government in healthcare.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Privatization of VA Healthcare:**  The emphasis on expanding community care could lead to a gradual privatization of VA healthcare, potentially making it more expensive and less accessible for veterans, particularly those in rural areas or with specialized needs.
* **Reduced Benefits for Disabled Veterans:**  The proposals to reform the disability benefits system could make it more difficult for veterans to receive the benefits they deserve and could lead to a decrease in support for disabled veterans.
* **Politicization of the VA:**  The proposals to transfer career SES employees out of politically appointed positions and to strengthen political control over the VA could lead to a more politicized and less accountable agency, potentially prioritizing loyalty over expertise and experience.
* **Weakening of Employee Protections:**  The proposals to re-evaluate telework policies and to improve the VBA's acquisition workforce could reduce flexibility for VA employees and lead to a greater reliance on private contractors, potentially undermining worker protections and job security.
* **Erosion of Trust in the VA:**  The combination of these changes could erode trust in the VA among veterans, making them less likely to seek the care and support they need.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 20 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for the VA that emphasizes efficiency, accountability, and a reduced role for the federal government in providing healthcare and benefits to veterans. The chapter's recommendations could lead to an expansion of community care, a tightening of eligibility requirements for disability benefits, and a greater reliance on private contractors. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a decrease in the quality of care and services provided to veterans, particularly those who are low-income, disabled, or rely on specialized care that is only available within the VA system.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, reflects the conservative agenda to shrink the role of the federal government in providing social services and to promote a more market-oriented approach to government programs. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of American veterans, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less generous and less effective VA under a future conservative administration.
