title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 22
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of the Treasury](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_22.pdf)

**Authors:** William L. Walton, Stephen Moore, and David R. Burton

Chapter 22 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of the Treasury, arguing that it has strayed from its core mission of promoting economic growth and fiscal responsibility under the Biden Administration. The authors, all prominent conservative economists with ties to the Trump administration, advocate for a return to conservative principles of limited government, free markets, and sound money. They outline a plan to reform the tax code, reduce the size and scope of the IRS, strengthen financial regulation in a way that benefits corporations, counter China's economic aggression, and roll back the Biden Administration's "equity" and "climate change" agendas.

The chapter's significance lies in its radical vision for a smaller, less interventionist Treasury Department that prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation of the financial industry, and a confrontational approach to China. These proposals could lead to a significant decrease in government revenue, a weakening of financial regulations, and an exacerbation of income inequality and racial disparities. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less sustainable economy under a future conservative administration.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Fiscal Responsibility through Spending Cuts:** The authors prioritize balancing the federal budget through deep spending cuts rather than tax increases, arguing that the Biden Administration's fiscal policies are reckless and unsustainable. This reflects a traditional conservative focus on reducing the size and scope of government.
* **Tax Cuts and Simplification:** The authors advocate for significant tax cuts and simplification, including a flat tax or consumption tax, arguing that this would boost economic growth and reduce compliance costs. This aligns with the long-standing conservative goal of reducing taxes, particularly for corporations and wealthy individuals.
* **Free Markets and Deregulation:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of free markets and deregulation, arguing that government intervention in the economy is often harmful and that the private sector is better equipped to allocate resources and create jobs.
* **Sound Money:** The authors advocate for "sound money" policies, suggesting a skepticism towards the Federal Reserve's monetary policies and a potential interest in returning to the gold standard or other forms of monetary restraint.
* **Countering China:** The chapter echoes the concerns raised in previous chapters about China's economic and national security threats and calls for the Treasury Department to play a more active role in countering those threats, including through sanctions, investment restrictions, and trade policies.
* **Rejection of "Woke" Policies:** The authors criticize the Biden Administration's focus on "equity" and "climate change," arguing that these are distractions from the Treasury's core mission and that they are harmful to the economy. This reflects a broader conservative rejection of what they perceive as "woke" ideology and a desire to roll back those initiatives.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on fiscal responsibility, tax cuts, deregulation, countering China, and rejecting "woke" policies aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Increased Inequality:** The proposals to cut taxes and weaken the IRS could lead to a significant increase in income inequality, as wealthy individuals and corporations would benefit disproportionately from the tax cuts while the government's ability to fund social programs and address inequality would be diminished.
* **Weakening of Financial Regulations:** The proposals to streamline financial regulation and reduce the role of government in financial markets could lead to a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, potentially harming consumers, destabilizing the economy, and increasing the risk of predatory lending and financial fraud.
* **Erosion of Social Programs:** The emphasis on balancing the budget through spending cuts could lead to deep cuts in social programs, education, and other vital government services, harming vulnerable populations, increasing poverty, and undermining the social safety net.
* **Exacerbating Climate Change:** The rejection of the Biden Administration's "climate change" agenda could undermine efforts to address this global challenge and could lead to a more polluting and less sustainable economy, potentially increasing the risks and costs associated with climate change.
* **Increased Racial Disparities:** The rejection of the Biden Administration's "equity" agenda could exacerbate racial and economic disparities, as minority communities would be disproportionately harmed by cuts to social programs, a weakening of financial regulations, and a lack of focus on addressing systemic racism.
