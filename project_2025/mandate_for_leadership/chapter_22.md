**[Chapter 22: Department of the Treasury](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_22.pdf)**

**Authors:** William L. Walton, Stephen Moore, and David R. Burton

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of the Treasury, arguing that it has strayed from its core mission of promoting economic growth and fiscal responsibility under the Biden Administration. The authors advocate for a return to conservative principles of limited government, free markets, and sound money. They outline a plan to reform the tax code, reduce the size and scope of the IRS, strengthen financial regulation, counter China's economic aggression, and roll back the Biden Administration's "equity" and "climate change" agendas.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Fiscal Responsibility and Balanced Budget:** The authors prioritize balancing the federal budget through spending cuts rather than tax increases, arguing that the Biden Administration's fiscal policies are reckless and unsustainable.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to deep cuts in social programs, education, and other vital government services, harming vulnerable populations and undermining the social safety net.
* **Tax Cuts and Simplification:** The authors advocate for significant tax cuts and simplification, including a flat tax or consumption tax, arguing that this would boost economic growth and reduce compliance costs.
    * **Concern:** This would disproportionately benefit wealthy individuals and corporations, exacerbate income inequality, and could lead to a decrease in government revenue, making it more difficult to fund essential services.
* **Reining in the IRS:** The authors criticize the IRS as being "poorly managed, utterly unresponsive, and increasingly politicized" and call for reducing its size and scope, limiting its enforcement powers, and strengthening taxpayer rights and privacy protections.
    * **Concern:** This could weaken the IRS's ability to enforce tax laws and collect revenue, potentially leading to increased tax evasion and a decrease in government funding for essential programs.
* **Countering China's Economic Aggression:** The authors echo the concerns raised in previous chapters about China's economic and national security threats and call for the Treasury Department to play a more active role in countering those threats, including through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a more confrontational and less cooperative approach to economic relations with China, potentially harming American businesses and consumers.
* **Reversing the "Equity" Agenda:** The authors criticize the Biden Administration's focus on "equity" and call for eliminating the Treasury's Counselor for Racial Equity, Advisory Committee on Racial Equity, and Office for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility.
    * **Concern:** This would undermine efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the financial sector and could exacerbate racial and economic disparities.
* **Reversing the "Climate Change" Agenda:** The authors criticize the Biden Administration's focus on "combating climate change" and call for eliminating the Treasury's Climate Hub Office and withdrawing from international climate agreements.
    * **Concern:** This would undermine efforts to address climate change, a major threat to the global economy and the environment.

**Summary:**

Chapter 22 outlines a conservative vision for the Treasury Department that prioritizes tax cuts, deregulation, a smaller government, and a confrontational approach to China. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a significant decrease in government revenue, a weakening of financial regulations, and an exacerbation of income inequality and racial disparities. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less sustainable economy under a future conservative administration.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Increased Inequality:** The proposals to cut taxes and weaken the IRS could lead to a significant increase in income inequality, as wealthy individuals and corporations would benefit disproportionately from the tax cuts.
* **Weakening of Financial Regulations:** The proposals to streamline financial regulation and reduce the role of government in financial markets could lead to a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, potentially harming consumers and the economy.
* **Erosion of Social Programs:** The emphasis on balancing the budget through spending cuts could lead to deep cuts in social programs, education, and other vital government services, harming vulnerable populations and undermining the social safety net.
* **Exacerbating Climate Change:** The rejection of the Biden Administration's "climate change" agenda could undermine efforts to address this global challenge and could lead to a more polluting and less sustainable economy.
* **Increased Racial Disparities:** The rejection of the Biden Administration's "equity" agenda could exacerbate racial and economic disparities, as minority communities would be disproportionately harmed by cuts to social programs and a weakening of financial regulations.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reinforces the pattern of "Project 2025" to promote a conservative agenda that prioritizes free markets, limited government, and individual responsibility over government intervention, social welfare, and environmental protection. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the American economy and the lives of millions of Americans, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less just and less equitable society under a future conservative administration.
