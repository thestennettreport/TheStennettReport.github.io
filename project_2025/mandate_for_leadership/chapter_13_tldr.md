title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 13 - Environmental Protection Agency - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 13](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_13.pdf) outlines a plan to gut the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), weaken environmental regulations, and prioritize corporate interests over environmental protection and public health.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **"Back to Basics":**  The chapter calls for a "back to basics" approach to environmental protection, suggesting a narrower scope for the EPA and a rejection of its role in addressing climate change.
* **State Leadership:** It emphasizes the importance of state leadership in environmental protection, advocating for a more decentralized approach and potentially allowing states to weaken federal standards.
* **Cooperative Federalism:** It calls for "cooperative federalism," suggesting that the EPA should work collaboratively with states rather than imposing regulations, potentially weakening enforcement of national standards.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** It advocates for a more rigorous use of cost-benefit analysis, potentially downplaying the benefits of environmental protection and leading to weaker regulations.
* **"Sound Science":** It emphasizes the use of "sound science," a term often used by conservatives to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change and other environmental issues.

**Critical Quote:**

"EPAâ€™s structure and mission should be greatly circumscribed to reflect the principles of cooperative federalism and limited government."

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a plan to significantly weaken the EPA and environmental protections, potentially leading to increased pollution, environmental degradation, and a failure to address the urgent threat of climate change.

**Red Flags:**

* **Weakening Environmental Protections:**  The chapter's recommendations could lead to a rollback of regulations that protect clean air, clean water, and endangered species, harming public health and the environment.
* **Ignoring Climate Change:**  The emphasis on "back to basics" and the criticism of a "global, climate-themed agenda" suggest a disregard for the urgency of addressing climate change.
* **Undermining the EPA:**  Reducing the EPA's budget, limiting its authority, and promoting state leadership could weaken the agency's ability to effectively protect the environment.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 13](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_13.pdf) outlines a dangerous agenda that prioritizes corporate interests and a narrow interpretation of the EPA's mission over the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. It's a recipe for environmental disaster, driven by ideology and a disregard for science.
