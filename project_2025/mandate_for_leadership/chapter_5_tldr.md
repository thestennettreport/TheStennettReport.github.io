title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 5 - Department of Homeland Security - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 5](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_5.pdf) outlines a radical plan to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and create a new, more powerful border and immigration agency with a hardline enforcement approach, prioritizing the deportation of undocumented immigrants and the militarization of the border.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Dismantle DHS:** The chapter argues that DHS has failed and should be dismantled, with its functions redistributed to other departments, reflecting a deep distrust of the agency and its effectiveness.
* **New Immigration Enforcement Agency:** It proposes creating a powerful new agency focused solely on border security and immigration enforcement, consolidating functions from CBP, ICE, and USCIS.
* **Hardline Enforcement:** It advocates for a hardline approach to immigration, including building a border wall, increasing deportations, cracking down on "sanctuary cities," and eliminating various visa programs.
* **Empowering State and Local Law Enforcement:**  It calls for giving state and local law enforcement greater authority to enforce immigration laws, even in jurisdictions that have chosen not to do so.

**Critical Quote:**

"Our primary recommendation is that the President pursue legislation to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)."

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a plan to radically reshape immigration enforcement in the U.S., creating a more restrictive, punitive, and potentially inhumane system that prioritizes deportation and border security over the rights and well-being of immigrants.

**Red Flags:**

* **Mass Deportations:**  The creation of a powerful new agency focused on enforcement could lead to mass deportations, separating families and harming communities.
* **Erosion of Asylum:**  The proposals to restrict asylum and expedite removals would make it more difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to find safety in the U.S.
* **Increased Racial Profiling:**  Empowering local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws could lead to increased racial profiling and a decline in trust between police and minority communities.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 5](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_5.pdf) outlines a dangerous and inhumane approach to immigration, prioritizing enforcement and exclusion over compassion and integration, potentially transforming the U.S. into a fortress nation that turns its back on those seeking a better life.
