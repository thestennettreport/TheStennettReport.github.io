### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Onward!](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/onward.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./onward_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Edwin J. Feulner, Founder and Former President of The Heritage Foundation

The concluding section of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership," titled "Onward!," serves as a rousing call to action for conservatives, urging them to embrace the project as a guide for achieving a conservative revolution in government. Authored by Edwin J. Feulner, founder and former president of The Heritage Foundation, the section celebrates the successes of the Reagan and Trump Administrations in implementing conservative policies and suggests that the next conservative President can achieve similar transformative results by following the recommendations outlined in "Mandate for Leadership."

The significance of "Onward!" lies in its explicit call for a radical reshaping of the federal government and American society according to conservative principles. Feulner's vision of a smaller, less intrusive government that prioritizes free markets, individual responsibility, and traditional values over government intervention, social welfare, and environmental protection is likely to be deeply concerning to Democrats and many Americans who value the role of government in addressing social and economic problems and promoting equality and opportunity for all.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Mandate as a Blueprint for Conservative Revolution:** Feulner presents "Mandate for Leadership" as a blueprint for a conservative revolution, arguing that it provides a comprehensive plan to dismantle the administrative state, reduce the size and scope of government, and advance conservative policies across all areas of government.
* **"People are Policy":** Feulner emphasizes the importance of personnel in implementing a conservative agenda, arguing that the next President must appoint individuals who are "principled" and "aligned with the President’s conservative vision." This suggests a desire to politicize the federal workforce and to prioritize loyalty over expertise and experience.
* **"Watch the Watchers":** Feulner argues that presidential appointees must serve as "watchdogs" to "rein in" federal agencies and prevent them from overreaching their authority. He specifically mentions the EPA, IRS, and OSHA as agencies that need to be reined in, reflecting a deep distrust of the federal bureaucracy.
* **Conservative Solutions vs. Liberal Failures:** Feulner repeatedly contrasts "conservative solutions" with "liberal policies," arguing that conservative policies are more effective in promoting economic growth, individual freedom, and national security. This rhetoric oversimplifies complex policy issues and ignores the successes of liberal policies in areas such as social welfare, education, and healthcare.
* **Historical Continuity and the Reagan Revolution:** Feulner draws a direct line from the Reagan Revolution to Project 2025, arguing that the project is a continuation of the conservative movement's long-term effort to transform America. He celebrates the successes of the Reagan and Trump administrations in implementing conservative policies and suggests that the next conservative President can achieve similar results.
