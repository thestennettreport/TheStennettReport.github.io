title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 4 - Department of Defense
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Defense](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_4.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_4_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Christopher Miller, Former Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense

Chapter 4 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Defense (DOD), the largest and most expensive part of the federal government. Authored by Christopher Miller, former Acting Secretary of Defense under President Trump, the chapter paints a bleak picture of a DOD weakened by "leftist politics" and the "Biden Administration's profoundly unserious equity agenda." Miller outlines a plan to restore the DOD's focus on "warfighting" and to prepare the nation for "great-power competition," particularly with China.

The chapter's significance lies in its hawkish tone and its emphasis on military strength and confrontation, particularly with China. It advocates for increased military spending, a renewed focus on nuclear weapons, and a rollback of efforts to promote diversity and inclusion within the military. These proposals could have a destabilizing effect on international relations and undermine America's moral standing in the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for unnecessary conflict and a militarization of American foreign policy.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **China as the Primary Threat:** Miller identifies China as the "most significant danger" to American security and calls for a "denial defense" strategy to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.
* **Military Strength and "Warfighting":** The chapter emphasizes the need for a strong military focused on "warfighting" capabilities, suggesting a preference for military solutions over diplomacy or other approaches.
* **Increased Military Spending:** Miller argues that the U.S. needs to spend more on defense to counter the threats posed by China, Russia, and other adversaries, even if it means cutting other domestic programs.
* **Rejection of "Woke" Culture:** Miller echoes the criticism of "woke" culture found throughout Project 2025, arguing that it is weakening the military and undermining morale. He calls for eliminating programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, critical race theory, and transgender service.
* **American Exceptionalism and Global Leadership:** The chapter reflects a belief in American exceptionalism and the need for the U.S. to maintain its global military dominance.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 4 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a plan to significantly reorient the Department of Defense toward a more aggressive and confrontational posture, particularly with respect to China. Miller's recommendations would likely lead to increased military spending, a renewed focus on nuclear weapons, and a rollback of efforts to promote diversity and inclusion within the military. These proposals could have a destabilizing effect on international relations and undermine America's moral standing in the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for unnecessary conflict and a militarization of American foreign policy.

This chapter, perhaps more than any other, highlights the stark differences in worldview between conservatives and liberals on issues of national security and foreign policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the future of America's role in the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a more militaristic and less diplomatic approach to international relations.
