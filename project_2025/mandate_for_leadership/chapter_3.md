title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 3
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_3.pdf)

**Authors:** Donald Devine, Dennis Dean Kirk, and Paul Dans

Chapter 3 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the central personnel agencies responsible for managing the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). The authors, all staunch conservatives with experience in government, argue that the current civil service system is broken and needs radical reform to make it more responsive to political leadership and less accountable to unions.

The chapter's significance lies in its stark departure from traditional norms of civil service neutrality and merit-based hiring. It advocates for a more politicized bureaucracy, where loyalty to the President's agenda trumps expertise and experience. This approach raises serious concerns about potential abuses of power, a decline in the quality of government services, and a chilling effect on dissent within the federal workforce.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **"Personnel is Policy":** This recurring theme emphasizes the belief that controlling the personnel within the federal bureaucracy is essential for implementing a conservative agenda. 
* **Distrust of the Civil Service:** The authors express a deep distrust of the current civil service system, portraying it as a self-serving bureaucracy resistant to change and accountable to unions rather than the President.
* **Weakening Civil Service Protections:** The chapter advocates for weakening civil service protections that make it difficult to fire federal employees, arguing that these protections hinder accountability and responsiveness to political leadership.
* **Hostility Towards Unions:** The authors view public sector unions as a major obstacle to effective government management and call for restricting their power, potentially even eliminating them altogether.
* **Schedule F: A Tool for Control:** The chapter praises Trump's Executive Order 13957, which created Schedule F to reclassify certain federal employees as "at-will" employees, making them easier to fire. They see this as a key tool for a conservative President to control the bureaucracy.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: The "Personnel is Policy" Imperative <sup>(98)</sup>**

* The authors establish the central theme of the chapter: "personnel is policy," arguing that a President's ability to implement his agenda depends on controlling the federal workforce.
* They criticize the current civil service system as being "unresponsive" and "unaccountable" to political leadership.
* **Quote:** "The first principle of public administration is that 'personnel is policy.'"

**3.2 The Problem: A "Broken" Civil Service <sup>(99)</sup>**

* The authors diagnose the problem as a "broken" civil service system that protects incompetent and unmotivated employees.
* They argue that civil service protections make it nearly impossible to fire federal employees, even for poor performance or misconduct.
* They also criticize the influence of public sector unions, arguing that they prioritize their own interests over the interests of taxpayers and the efficient functioning of government.

**3.3 The Solution: Restoring Presidential Control <sup>(102)</sup>**

* The authors propose a series of reforms to restore presidential control over the federal workforce, including:
    * **Weakening Civil Service Protections:** Making it easier to fire federal employees for poor performance, misconduct, or lack of alignment with the President's agenda.
    * **Restricting Unions:** Limiting the power of public sector unions, potentially even eliminating them altogether.
    * **Reforming Hiring Practices:**  Making hiring practices more flexible and less reliant on objective criteria, allowing for greater consideration of political loyalty and ideological alignment.
    * **Reforming Performance Appraisals:**  Implementing a more rigorous performance appraisal system that can be used to justify firing employees for subjective reasons.

**3.4 Schedule F: A "Bold Step" <sup>(113)</sup>**

* The authors praise Trump's Executive Order 13957, which created Schedule F, as a "bold step" towards restoring presidential control over the bureaucracy.
* They argue that Schedule F would allow a President to reclassify certain federal employees as "at-will" employees, making them easier to fire.
* **Quote:** "Schedule F was a bold step in the right direction, but it was only a first step."

**3.5 Conclusion: A Call to Action <sup>(116)</sup>**

* The authors conclude by urging a future conservative President to "take bold action" to reform the civil service system and to "restore accountability and responsiveness to the American people."
* They argue that these reforms are essential for "draining the swamp" and for "making America great again."

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 3 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a plan to significantly weaken the civil service system, making it easier for a conservative President to control the federal workforce and implement his agenda. This vision for a more politicized and less accountable bureaucracy raises serious concerns among Democrats about potential abuses of power and a disregard for the expertise and experience of career civil servants.

The chapter's recommendations, if implemented, could have a chilling effect on the ability of the federal government to function effectively and impartially. They represent a significant departure from traditional norms of governance and civil service neutrality, suggesting a willingness to use the power of the executive branch to advance a partisan agenda and silence dissenting voices.
