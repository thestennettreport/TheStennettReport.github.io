title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 28 - Federal Communications Commission - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 28](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_28.pdf) outlines a plan to reshape the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to advance a conservative agenda, focusing on reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, and deregulating the communications industry.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Reining in Big Tech:** The chapter emphasizes the need to address the perceived "threats to individual liberty" posed by Big Tech companies, particularly their alleged power to censor conservative speech and control information online.
* **Promoting National Security:** It highlights the FCC's role in protecting national security, advocating for a more aggressive approach to countering Chinese influence in the telecommunications sector, including banning certain Chinese companies.
* **Free Markets and Deregulation:** It advocates for a more market-oriented approach to communications policy, arguing that deregulation and a reduced role for government will foster innovation, competition, and economic growth.
* **Streamlining Regulations:** It calls for streamlining regulations, eliminating outdated rules, and promoting efficiency at the FCC, reflecting a broader conservative focus on reducing the regulatory burden on businesses.
* **Accountability and Transparency:** It emphasizes the need for greater accountability and transparency at the FCC, including ending wasteful spending and adopting clear performance metrics.

**Critical Quote:**

"The FCC has an important role to play in addressing the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market. Nowhere is that clearer than when it comes to Big Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square."

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a plan to use the FCC to advance a partisan agenda, potentially leading to a rollback of net neutrality rules, increased censorship of online content, a weakening of consumer protections, and a more confrontational approach to China.

**Red Flags:**

* **Erosion of Net Neutrality:**  The chapter's support for deregulation could lead to a rollback of net neutrality rules, allowing internet service providers to prioritize certain content and discriminate against others, creating a less open and fair internet.
* **Increased Censorship:**  The call for a narrower interpretation of Section 230 could lead to increased censorship by online platforms, as they may be more likely to remove content to avoid liability, potentially stifling free speech and diverse viewpoints online.
* **Weakening of Consumer Protections:**  Deregulation and a reduced role for government could lead to a weakening of consumer protections in the communications industry, potentially resulting in higher prices, fewer choices, and worse service for consumers.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 28](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_28.pdf) outlines a conservative vision for the FCC that prioritizes partisan goals over a neutral approach to regulation, potentially leading to a less free, less fair, and less competitive communications landscape.
