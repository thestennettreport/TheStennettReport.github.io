title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 12 - Department of Energy and Related Commissions - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 12](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_12.pdf) outlines a plan to promote "American energy dominance" by unleashing fossil fuel production, rolling back environmental regulations, and undermining support for renewable energy, ignoring the urgency of the climate crisis.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Fossil Fuel Focus:** The chapter prioritizes fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, and coal, arguing that they are essential for energy independence, economic growth, and national security.
* **Deregulation:** It calls for a sweeping deregulation of the energy industry, arguing that government intervention stifles innovation and raises energy prices.
* **Repealing Green Subsidies:** It advocates for repealing subsidies for renewable energy and electric vehicles, claiming they are "corporate welfare" and distort the market.
* **Promoting Nuclear Power:** It calls for streamlining the approval process for new nuclear power plants, despite the risks and costs associated with nuclear energy.
* **Climate Change Skepticism:** It downplays the urgency of addressing climate change and criticizes the Biden Administration's "green" policies as being harmful to the economy.

**Critical Quote:**

"The next conservative Administration should prioritize energy and science dominance to ensure that Americans have abundant, affordable, and reliable energy; create good-paying jobs; support domestic manufacturing and technology leadership; and strengthen national security." (p. 396)

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a dangerous agenda that prioritizes fossil fuels over clean energy, deregulation over environmental protection, and short-term economic gains over the long-term health of our planet.

**Red Flags:**

* **Exacerbating Climate Change:**  Promoting fossil fuels and rolling back environmental regulations would accelerate climate change, leading to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and other devastating consequences.
* **Harming Public Health:**  Increased air and water pollution from fossil fuel production would harm public health, particularly in communities near energy extraction and processing facilities.
* **Undermining Clean Energy Innovation:**  Repealing subsidies and discouraging investment in renewable energy would stifle innovation and hinder the transition to a clean energy economy.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 12](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_12.pdf) outlines a reckless and short-sighted energy policy that prioritizes the interests of the fossil fuel industry over the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. It's a recipe for environmental disaster, driven by ideology and a disregard for science.
