title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 10 - Department of Agriculture - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 10](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_10.pdf) outlines a plan to reshape the Department of Agriculture (USDA) by shrinking its role, eliminating farm subsidies, slashing food assistance programs, and prioritizing corporate interests over the needs of farmers and low-income families.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Free Markets Above All:** The chapter emphasizes the need to reduce government intervention in agriculture, arguing that the free market is the best way to ensure food security and affordability.
* **Eliminating Farm Subsidies:** It calls for eliminating or significantly reforming farm subsidies, arguing that they distort markets, discourage innovation, and harm taxpayers.
* **Gutting Food Assistance:** It recommends moving all USDA food and nutrition programs, including SNAP and WIC, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), potentially leading to cuts in benefits and eligibility.
* **Attacking School Meals:** It argues that federal school meal programs have strayed from their original intent and calls for eliminating the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows schools in high-poverty areas to offer free meals to all students.
* **Weakening Environmental Protections:** It advocates for eliminating the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which pays farmers to take environmentally sensitive land out of production, and for weakening conservation easements.

**Critical Quote:**

"The federal government does not need to transform the food system or develop a national plan to intervene across the supply chain. Instead, it should respect American farmers, truckers, and everyone who makes the food supply chain so resilient and successful."

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a plan to radically reshape agricultural policy, prioritizing corporate interests and a free-market ideology over the needs of farmers, rural communities, and low-income families who rely on food assistance.

**Red Flags:**

* **Increased Hunger and Food Insecurity:**  Cutting farm subsidies and food assistance programs could lead to increased hunger and food insecurity, particularly among low-income families.
* **Environmental Degradation:**  Eliminating conservation programs and weakening environmental regulations could lead to increased pollution, soil erosion, and habitat loss.
* **Harm to Small Farmers:**  Eliminating subsidies could disproportionately harm small farmers who rely on them to stay afloat, leading to farm consolidation and a less diverse agricultural sector.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 10](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_10.pdf) outlines a dangerous agenda that would undermine food security, harm vulnerable populations, and weaken environmental protections, all in the name of free markets and a smaller government.
