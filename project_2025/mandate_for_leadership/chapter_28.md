title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 28 - Federal Communications Commission
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Federal Communications Commission](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_28.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_28_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Brendan Carr, Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

Chapter 28 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the agency responsible for regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. Authored by Brendan Carr, a Republican FCC Commissioner appointed by President Trump, the chapter outlines a conservative vision for the agency that prioritizes reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, unleashing economic prosperity through deregulation, and ensuring accountability and good governance. Carr argues that the FCC has a crucial role to play in protecting individual liberty, securing communications networks, and fostering innovation and competition, but his vision reflects a partisan agenda that prioritizes conservative priorities over a neutral approach to regulation.

The chapter's significance lies in its potential to reshape the regulatory landscape for the internet and the communications industry, with implications for free speech, net neutrality, consumer privacy, and competition. While some of Carr's proposals, such as those related to broadband connectivity and infrastructure modernization, may find bipartisan support, others, such as those related to Section 230 and countering China, are likely to be more controversial and could raise concerns among Democrats about the potential for government overreach, censorship, and a weakening of consumer protections.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Reining in Big Tech:** Carr emphasizes the need to address the "threats to individual liberty" posed by Big Tech companies, particularly their alleged power to censor conservative speech and control information online. This reflects a broader conservative concern about Big Tech's influence and a belief that these companies are biased against conservative viewpoints.
* **Promoting National Security:** Carr highlights the FCC's role in protecting national security, particularly from threats posed by China. He advocates for a more aggressive approach to countering Chinese influence in the telecommunications sector, including through stricter regulations and a ban on certain Chinese companies.
* **Free Markets and Deregulation:** Carr advocates for a more market-oriented approach to communications policy, arguing that deregulation and a reduced role for government will foster innovation, competition, and economic growth. This aligns with the broader conservative preference for free markets and limited government intervention in the economy.
* **Streamlining Regulations and Promoting Efficiency:** The chapter calls for streamlining regulations, eliminating outdated rules, and promoting efficiency at the FCC. This reflects a broader conservative focus on reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and making government more efficient.
* **Accountability and Transparency:** Carr emphasizes the need for greater accountability and transparency at the FCC, including ending wasteful spending, adopting clear performance metrics, and making the agency's decision-making process more transparent.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, and deregulation aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 4](./chapter_4.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Defense, complements Chapter 28 by highlighting the national security threats posed by China, particularly in the area of technology.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 21](./chapter_21.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Commerce, supports Chapter 28 by advocating for a more confrontational approach to China and for strengthening export controls to prevent the transfer of sensitive technologies.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Erosion of Net Neutrality:**  Carr's support for a more market-oriented approach to communications policy could lead to a rollback of net neutrality rules, potentially allowing internet service providers to prioritize certain content and discriminate against others, leading to a less open and less fair internet.
* **Increased Censorship:**  A narrower interpretation of Section 230 could lead to increased censorship by online platforms, as they may be more likely to remove content to avoid liability, potentially stifling free speech and diverse viewpoints online.
* **Weakening of Consumer Protections:**  The emphasis on deregulation and a reduced role for government could lead to a weakening of consumer protections in the communications industry, potentially resulting in higher prices, fewer choices, and worse service for consumers, particularly in rural areas or for low-income households.
* **Anti-China Bias:**  The chapter's focus on countering China's influence could lead to discriminatory policies against Chinese businesses and individuals in the U.S. and could undermine efforts to build a constructive relationship with China, potentially escalating tensions and harming economic cooperation.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Government Overreach:**  Critics might argue that Carr's proposals to reinterpret Section 230 and to expand the FCC's authority over online content moderation represent government overreach and could lead to censorship of legitimate speech.
* **Harm to Free Speech:**  Opponents might argue that a narrower interpretation of Section 230 would chill free speech online, as platforms would be more likely to remove content to avoid liability, even if it is protected by the First Amendment.
* **Weakening of Consumer Protections:**  Critics might argue that deregulation and a reduced role for government would lead to a weakening of consumer protections, potentially resulting in higher prices, fewer choices, and worse service for consumers.
* **Discrimination Against Chinese Companies:**  Opponents might argue that the chapter's focus on countering China's influence is based on fearmongering and could lead to discriminatory policies against Chinese businesses and individuals in the U.S.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 28 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for the FCC that prioritizes reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, and fostering a more market-oriented approach to communications policy. While some of Carr's proposals, such as those related to broadband connectivity and infrastructure modernization, may find bipartisan support, others, such as those related to Section 230 and China, are likely to be more controversial and could raise concerns among Democrats about the potential for government overreach, censorship, and a weakening of consumer protections.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, highlights the conservative agenda to reduce the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and to promote a more individualistic and less equitable approach to social policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the internet, the communications industry, and U.S.-China relations, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less free, less fair, and less stable world under a future conservative administration.
