title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 30 - Federal Trade Commission - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 30](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_30.pdf) outlines a plan to reshape the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to advance a conservative agenda, expanding the scope of antitrust law to target Big Tech, challenge ESG initiatives, and empower state attorneys general to pursue politically motivated investigations.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Broader View of Antitrust:** The chapter advocates for a broader view of antitrust law, going beyond the traditional focus on consumer welfare to encompass the protection of "democratic values" like free speech and shareholder control. This could be used to target companies based on their political views or social stances rather than their impact on competition.
* **Crackdown on Big Tech:** It highlights the power of Big Tech companies and calls for the FTC to take a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement against them, potentially stifling innovation and competition in the digital marketplace.
* **Cooperation with State AGs:** It recommends that the FTC increase its cooperation with state attorneys general, potentially empowering Republican AGs to pursue politically motivated investigations against companies they disagree with.
* **Skepticism Towards ESG:** The chapter criticizes ESG (environmental, social, and governance) initiatives, arguing that they can be used as a cover for anticompetitive behavior and are often driven by political rather than economic considerations, reflecting a broader conservative backlash against ESG.
* **Protecting Children Online:** It argues that the FTC should investigate online platforms' practices that target children, such as advertising and data collection, potentially leading to overregulation of the internet and a chilling effect on free speech.

**Critical Quote:**

"Antitrust law can combat dominant firmsâ€™ baleful effects on democratic institutions such as free speech, the marketplace of ideas, shareholder control, and managerial accountability as well as collusive behavior with government."

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a plan to politicize antitrust law and use it to target companies based on their political views, potentially stifling innovation, chilling free speech, and undermining consumer protections.

**Red Flags:**

* **Politicized Antitrust Enforcement:**  Expanding the scope of antitrust law to encompass "democratic values" could be used to target companies based on their political or social stances, rather than their impact on competition.
* **Chilling Effect on Innovation:**  The uncertainty created by this broader view of antitrust could stifle innovation and discourage investment, as companies may be hesitant to engage in activities that could be perceived as anticompetitive.
* **Weakening of Consumer Protections:**  The focus on "democratic values" could lead to a downplaying of consumer protection concerns, potentially resulting in weaker regulations that fail to adequately protect consumers from harmful business practices.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 30](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_30.pdf) outlines a dangerous plan to weaponize antitrust law for political purposes, potentially harming consumers, stifling innovation, and undermining the free market principles that conservatives claim to champion.
