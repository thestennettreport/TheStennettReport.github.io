title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 24 - Federal Reserve 
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Federal Reserve](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_24.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_24_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Paul Winfree, Distinguished Fellow in Economic Policy and Public Leadership at The Heritage Foundation

Chapter 24 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Federal Reserve (Fed), the central bank of the United States, arguing that it is responsible for "inflationary and recessionary cycles" and has become too powerful and politically influential. Authored by Paul Winfree, a Distinguished Fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council under President Trump, the chapter advocates for a radical restructuring of the Fed, including limiting its mandate to price stability, curbing its lender-of-last-resort function, winding down its balance sheet, and potentially abolishing it altogether in favor of "free banking" or a return to the gold standard.

The chapter's significance lies in its radical critique of the Fed and its advocacy for a return to a more laissez-faire approach to monetary policy. Winfree's recommendations, if implemented, could lead to higher interest rates, tighter credit conditions, increased financial instability, and a prioritization of fighting inflation over supporting full employment. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats and many mainstream economists about the potential for economic harm, a return to a less stable and less equitable financial system, and a disregard for the Fed's crucial role in stabilizing the economy.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Distrust of the Fed:** Winfree expresses a deep distrust of the Fed, arguing that it is unaccountable, prone to political influence, and responsible for economic instability. This reflects a broader libertarian and Austrian School of Economics perspective that views central banking as inherently harmful.
* **Focus on Price Stability:** The chapter prioritizes price stability as the sole objective of monetary policy, arguing that the Fed's dual mandate of maximizing employment and maintaining price stability is misguided and leads to inflation.
* **Limited Government Intervention:** Winfree advocates for a significantly reduced role for government in monetary policy, arguing that the free market is the best mechanism for allocating credit and determining interest rates.
* **Sound Money:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of "sound money," suggesting a preference for a gold standard or other forms of monetary restraint that limit the Fed's ability to manipulate the money supply.
* **Rejection of Keynesian Economics:** Winfree implicitly rejects Keynesian economics, which advocates for government intervention to stabilize the economy, arguing that such intervention is often counterproductive and leads to inflation and economic distortions.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: The Fed's "Failed Experiment" <sup>(764)</sup>**

* Winfree argues that the Fed's "experiment" with central banking has been a "failure," leading to inflation, recessions, and financial crises.
* He criticizes the Fed's lack of transparency and accountability and its susceptibility to political influence.
* **Quote:** "The Federal Reserve has failed to deliver on its promises of price stability and economic growth. It is time for a fundamental reform of our monetary system."

**3.2 The Problem: The Dual Mandate <sup>(766)</sup>**

* Winfree argues that the Fed's dual mandate of maximizing employment and maintaining price stability is "inherently contradictory" and leads to inflation.
* He claims that the Fed's focus on employment has led it to keep interest rates too low for too long, fueling asset bubbles and inflation.
* **Quote:** "The dual mandate is a recipe for inflation. It forces the Fed to choose between two competing goals, and it inevitably leads to a bias towards inflation."

**3.3 The Solution: A "Rules-Based" Monetary Policy <sup>(767)</sup>**

* Winfree advocates for a "rules-based" monetary policy, where the Fed would follow a set of predetermined rules, such as targeting a specific growth rate for the money supply or a specific inflation target.
* He argues that this would make monetary policy more predictable and less susceptible to political influence.
* **Quote:** "A rules-based monetary policy would take the politics out of monetary policy and would ensure that the Fed is focused on its primary mission of maintaining price stability."

**3.4 Specific Policy Recommendations <sup>(767)</sup>**

* **Limit the Fed's Mandate:**  Limit the Fed's mandate to price stability, eliminating its responsibility for maximizing employment. <sup>(766)</sup>
* **Curb the Lender of Last Resort:**  Limit the Fed's ability to act as a lender of last resort, arguing that this encourages banks to take excessive risks. <sup>(766)</sup>
* **Wind Down the Balance Sheet:**  Wind down the Fed's balance sheet, which has grown significantly since the 2008 financial crisis, by selling off its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. <sup>(767)</sup>
* **Consider Abolishing the Fed:**  Consider abolishing the Fed altogether and replacing it with a system of "free banking" or a return to the gold standard. <sup>(769)</sup>

**3.5 Conclusion: A Call for "Sound Money" <sup>(770)</sup>**

* Winfree concludes by calling for a return to "sound money" policies, arguing that this is essential for economic stability and prosperity.
* He claims that a sound monetary system would lead to lower inflation, more stable economic growth, and a stronger dollar.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on limited government, free markets, and "sound money" aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 2](./chapter_2.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Executive Office of the President, complements Chapter 24 by advocating for using the OMB to control agency spending and to implement the President's budgetary priorities, potentially influencing the Fed's monetary policy.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 22](./chapter_22.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of the Treasury, supports Chapter 24 by calling for a more conservative approach to fiscal policy, which could influence the Fed's monetary policy decisions.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Economic Instability:** The proposals to limit the Fed's role, including eliminating its dual mandate and lender-of-last-resort function, could lead to greater economic instability and a higher risk of financial crises, as the Fed would have fewer tools to respond to economic shocks.
* **Higher Unemployment:** The focus on price stability over full employment could lead to higher unemployment rates, particularly during economic downturns, as the Fed would be less likely to lower interest rates to stimulate job growth.
* **Recession Risk:** The proposals to wind down the Fed's balance sheet and raise interest rates could trigger a recession, harming businesses and consumers, as tighter credit conditions could slow down investment and spending.
* **Radical Monetary Reforms:** The suggestions to abolish the Fed and replace it with "free banking" or a gold standard are radical and untested ideas that could have unpredictable and potentially disastrous consequences for the U.S. economy, leading to hyperinflation, deflation, or other forms of monetary instability.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Ignoring the Fed's Successes:**  Critics might argue that the chapter ignores the Fed's successes in stabilizing the economy and preventing financial crises, such as its response to the 2008 financial crisis.
* **Oversimplifying Monetary Policy:**  Opponents might argue that the chapter oversimplifies the complexities of monetary policy and that a "rules-based" approach would be too rigid and inflexible to respond to changing economic conditions.
* **Harm to the Economy:**  Critics might argue that the chapter's recommendations would harm the economy by increasing interest rates, tightening credit conditions, and potentially triggering a recession.
* **Unrealistic and Impractical:**  Opponents might argue that the proposals to abolish the Fed and replace it with "free banking" or a gold standard are unrealistic and impractical, and that they would lead to greater economic instability.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 24 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a radical conservative vision for monetary policy that seeks to significantly reduce the role of the Federal Reserve and potentially eliminate it altogether. The chapter's recommendations could lead to higher interest rates, tighter credit conditions, increased financial instability, and a prioritization of fighting inflation over supporting full employment. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats and many mainstream economists about the potential for economic harm and a return to a less stable and less equitable financial system.

This chapter highlights the deep ideological divide between conservatives and liberals on monetary policy. Winfree's proposals represent a significant departure from the mainstream consensus on the role of the Federal Reserve and could lead to a dramatic shift in U.S. monetary policy under a future conservative administration. Democrats are likely to view these proposals as dangerous and irresponsible, raising serious concerns about the potential for economic harm and a return to a less stable and less equitable financial system.
