title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 12
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Energy and Related Commissions](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_12.pdf)

**Author:** Bernard L. McNamee, Former Member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)

Chapter 12 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Energy (DOE) and related commissions, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Authored by Bernard L. McNamee, a former FERC member appointed by President Trump, the chapter argues that the Biden Administration's "extreme 'green' policies" have created an "artificial energy scarcity" and driven up energy prices. McNamee outlines a conservative vision for American energy policy that emphasizes "energy dominance," an "all of the above" approach that prioritizes fossil fuels, and a reduced role for government in energy markets.

The chapter's significance lies in its stark rejection of renewable energy and climate action, advocating instead for a doubling down on fossil fuels and deregulation. McNamee's recommendations could lead to a rollback of environmental protections, a slowdown in the development of renewable energy sources, and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for exacerbating climate change and harming public health.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **"American Energy Dominance":** McNamee calls for a return to "American energy dominance," arguing that the U.S. should prioritize the production of fossil fuels to ensure abundant, affordable, and reliable energy. This reflects a broader conservative belief in energy independence and a rejection of global efforts to address climate change.
* **"All of the Above" Energy Policy:** While advocating for an "all of the above" energy policy, McNamee's emphasis is clearly on fossil fuels, suggesting a preference for traditional energy sources over renewable energy.
* **Deregulation and Free Markets:** The chapter advocates for deregulation and a reduced role for government in energy markets, arguing that the free market is the best mechanism for ensuring energy abundance and affordability.
* **Skepticism Towards Climate Change:** McNamee downplays the urgency of addressing climate change and criticizes the Biden Administration's "green" policies as being harmful to the economy.
* **National Security and Energy Independence:** The chapter emphasizes the national security implications of energy policy, arguing that energy independence is essential for protecting American interests and reducing reliance on foreign sources.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: A "War on American Energy" <sup>(382)</sup>**

* McNamee argues that the Biden Administration is waging a "war on American energy" through its "extreme 'green' policies."
* He claims that these policies have led to higher energy prices, job losses, and a weakening of national security.

### 5. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

* **Promote Fossil Fuels:**  Increase the production and consumption of fossil fuels, particularly oil, natural gas, and coal.
* **Reduce Government Intervention:**  Minimize the role of the federal government in energy markets, allowing the free market to determine energy production and prices.
* **Achieve Energy Independence:**  Reduce U.S. reliance on foreign sources of energy and become a net energy exporter.
* **Downplay Climate Change:**  Minimize the perceived urgency of addressing climate change and promote a skeptical view of climate science.
* **Strengthen National Security:**  Enhance national security by achieving energy independence and reducing reliance on foreign adversaries for energy.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on "American energy dominance," deregulation, and skepticism towards climate change aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.
* **Project 2025, Chapter 4:**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Defense, complements Chapter 12 by highlighting the national security implications of energy independence.
