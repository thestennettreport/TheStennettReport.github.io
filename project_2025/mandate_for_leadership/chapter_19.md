title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 19 - Department of Transportation
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Transportation](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_19.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_19_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Director of the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment at The Heritage Foundation

Chapter 19 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Transportation (DOT), arguing that the Biden Administration's "anti-fossil-fuel climate agenda" is driving up transportation costs, hindering infrastructure development, and reducing consumer choice. Furchtgott-Roth, a prominent conservative economist and director of the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, advocates for a more market-oriented approach to transportation policy, emphasizing affordability, abundance, safety, and a reduced role for government in transportation decisions.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a shift away from public transportation and environmental sustainability towards a greater reliance on private vehicles, deregulation, and a prioritization of traditional infrastructure projects like highways and roads. Furchtgott-Roth's recommendations could lead to cuts in funding for public transportation, a rollback of fuel economy standards, and a weakening of efforts to address climate change. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased transportation costs, reduced access to transportation for low-income communities, and a more polluting and less sustainable transportation system.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Free Markets and Limited Government:** Furchtgott-Roth emphasizes the role of free markets in driving innovation and efficiency in transportation, arguing that the government should play a limited role in regulating the industry and should instead focus on creating a favorable environment for private investment.
* **Prioritizing Affordability and Abundance:** The chapter prioritizes making transportation more "affordable" and "abundant," suggesting that current policies are making transportation too expensive and inaccessible. This rhetoric could be used to justify cuts to public transportation funding and a weakening of environmental regulations.
* **Skepticism Towards Climate Action:** Furchtgott-Roth expresses skepticism towards the urgency of addressing climate change and criticizes the Biden Administration's focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation as being costly and ineffective.
* **Emphasis on Traditional Infrastructure:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of traditional infrastructure projects, such as highways, roads, and bridges, suggesting a preference for these projects over investments in public transportation, bike lanes, and pedestrian infrastructure.
* **State and Local Control:** Furchtgott-Roth advocates for greater state and local control over transportation policy, arguing that the federal government should play a more limited role in funding and regulating transportation projects.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: A "Broken" Transportation System <sup>(644)</sup>**
