title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 9 - Agency for International Development
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Agency for International Development](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_9.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_9_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Max Primorac, Former Acting Chief Operating Officer and Assistant to the Administrator at USAID

Chapter 9 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the federal agency responsible for administering U.S. foreign aid. Authored by Max Primorac, a former senior official at USAID during the Trump administration, the chapter argues that the agency has been "deformed" by the Biden Administration's "divisive political and cultural agenda," which he claims prioritizes "woke" ideology over American interests and effective development assistance. Primorac outlines a plan to "deradicalize" USAID, reduce its global footprint, and refocus it on promoting conservative values and countering China's influence in the developing world.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a radical shift in U.S. foreign aid policy, away from promoting human rights, gender equality, and climate action, and towards advancing a conservative agenda and countering China. This approach raises serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for USAID to be used as a tool for promoting a partisan agenda, for undermining efforts to address global challenges, and for harming vulnerable populations in developing countries.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **"Deradicalizing" USAID:** Primorac calls for "deradicalizing" USAID by eliminating programs and initiatives related to abortion, climate change, and gender equality, arguing that these are "divisive" and "harmful." This reflects a broader conservative rejection of what they perceive as "woke" ideology and a desire to impose their own values on foreign aid.
* **Countering China:** The chapter emphasizes the need to counter China's growing influence in the developing world, arguing that China's development model is "authoritarian" and "exploitative." This aligns with the broader conservative focus on countering China's global rise and promoting American interests abroad.
* **Promoting Conservative Values:** Primorac advocates for using USAID to promote conservative social values, such as opposition to abortion and support for traditional families. This suggests a desire to use foreign aid as a tool for advancing a partisan agenda.
* **Reducing Foreign Aid:** Primorac calls for scaling back USAID's global footprint and returning to its 2019 budget level, arguing that the Biden Administration's budget increases are "wasteful." This reflects a broader conservative skepticism towards foreign aid and a preference for reducing government spending.
* **Empowering Faith-Based Organizations:** Primorac advocates for increasing funding to faith-based organizations, arguing that they are more effective than secular organizations in providing development assistance. This aligns with the conservative support for faith-based initiatives and a belief that they are better equipped to address social problems.

* **Erosion of Women's Rights:** The elimination of programs related to abortion and gender equality could undermine efforts to promote women's rights and reproductive health in developing countries.
* **Exacerbating Climate Change:** The rejection of climate change initiatives could undermine efforts to address this global challenge and harm vulnerable communities that are already experiencing the effects of climate change.
* **Promoting Religious Discrimination:** The emphasis on funding faith-based organizations could lead to discrimination against beneficiaries who do not share the religious beliefs of those organizations.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 9 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a plan to transform USAID into an agency that prioritizes conservative values and American interests over the needs of developing countries. The chapter's recommendations would likely lead to a reduction in foreign aid, a shift in funding priorities toward faith-based organizations, and a more confrontational approach to development assistance, particularly with respect to China. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for USAID to be used as a tool for promoting a partisan agenda and for undermining efforts to address global challenges like poverty, disease, and climate change.

This chapter, along with Chapters [4](./chapter_4.md), [6](./chapter_6.md), and [8](./chapter_8.md), reveals a clear pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to use the power of the federal government to advance a conservative agenda, even if it means sacrificing the interests of vulnerable populations, undermining democratic norms, and eroding America's global standing. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the lives of millions of people around the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the future direction of U.S. foreign policy and development assistance.
