title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 8 - Media Agencies - U.S. Agency for Global Media - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

[Chapter 8](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_8.pdf) outlines a plan to transform the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) into a propaganda arm of the government, prioritizing the promotion of "American values" and countering adversarial narratives over journalistic independence and objectivity.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Propaganda Over Journalism:** The chapter criticizes USAGM for allegedly "parrot[ing] America’s adversaries’ propaganda" and calls for a renewed focus on presenting "the truth about America and American policy," suggesting a shift towards promoting a pro-U.S. narrative rather than objective reporting.
* **Eliminating the "Firewall":** It criticizes the "firewall" that protects USAGM journalists from political interference, arguing that it has been used to shield "biased" reporting and calling for its removal to allow for greater political control over content.
* **Consolidating and Reducing Services:** It calls for consolidating and reducing services across USAGM's networks, potentially limiting the diversity of voices and perspectives represented and reducing the agency's reach and impact.
* **Prioritizing Traditional Media:** It advocates for investing in traditional broadcasting methods, such as shortwave radio, over digital platforms, despite the growing importance of the internet and social media in global communication.

**Critical Quote:**

"To fulfill its mission, USAGM should also aim to present the truth about America and American policy—not parrot America’s adversaries’ propaganda and talking points."

**Why It Matters:**

This chapter reveals a plan to turn USAGM into a tool for government propaganda, potentially undermining its credibility, eroding journalistic integrity, and damaging America's reputation as a champion of free speech and a free press.

**Red Flags:**

* **Government Propaganda:**  Eliminating the "firewall" and promoting "American values" could lead to USAGM being used to spread government propaganda rather than objective news and information.
* **Censorship and Bias:**  The call for more rigorous vetting of personnel and the removal of those deemed "biased" could lead to a purge of dissenting voices and a narrowing of perspectives.
* **Wasteful Spending:**  Investing in outdated technologies like shortwave radio could divert resources from more effective digital platforms.

**Bottom Line:**

[Chapter 8](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_8.pdf) outlines a dangerous plan to politicize USAGM and transform it into a propaganda machine, potentially undermining its credibility, harming its mission, and damaging America's global standing.
