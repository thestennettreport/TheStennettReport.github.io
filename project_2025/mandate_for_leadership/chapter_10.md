title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 10
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Agriculture](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_10.pdf)

**Author:** Daren Bakst, Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute

Chapter 10 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the agency responsible for overseeing American agriculture and food policy. Authored by Daren Bakst, a senior fellow at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, the chapter argues that the Biden Administration is seeking to "transform the food system" through a centralized plan that prioritizes climate change and "equity" over efficient food production and individual freedom. Bakst outlines a conservative vision for the USDA that emphasizes limited government intervention, sound science, and market-based solutions.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a radical shift in agricultural policy, away from government support for farmers and food assistance programs and towards a more laissez-faire approach. Bakst's recommendations could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly low-income families and farmers, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased hunger, environmental degradation, and a less competitive agricultural sector.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Limited Government:** Bakst emphasizes the need for limited government intervention in agriculture, arguing that the free market is the best mechanism for ensuring efficient food production and distribution.
* **Free Markets:** The chapter advocates for market-based solutions to agricultural challenges, arguing that government subsidies and regulations distort markets and harm consumers.
* **Individual Freedom:** Bakst stresses the importance of individual freedom for farmers and consumers, arguing that government programs should not interfere with their ability to make their own choices.
* **Sound Science:** The chapter calls for using "sound science" to inform agricultural policy, suggesting a skepticism towards climate change and other environmental concerns.
* **State and Local Control:** Bakst advocates for greater state and local control over agricultural policy, arguing that the federal government should play a more limited role.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: A "Transformative" Agenda <sup>(302)</sup>**

* Bakst criticizes the Biden Administration's "transformative" agenda for agriculture, arguing that it is based on a "false premise" that the government needs to intervene in the food system.
* He argues that the free market is the best mechanism for ensuring food security and affordability.
* **Quote:** "The Biden Administration is seeking to transform the food system in a way that would fundamentally alter the relationship between the government and agriculture."

**3.2 The Problem: Government Overreach <sup>(303)</sup>**

* Bakst argues that government overreach in agriculture has led to a number of problems, including:
    * **Distorted Markets:**  Government subsidies and regulations distort markets, leading to higher prices for consumers and unfair competition for farmers.
    * **Reduced Innovation:**  Government programs discourage innovation by creating a "culture of dependency" among farmers.
    * **Waste and Inefficiency:**  Government programs are often wasteful and inefficient, costing taxpayers billions of dollars.

**3.3 The Solution: Free Markets and Limited Government <sup>(306)</sup>**

* Bakst outlines a conservative vision for agriculture that emphasizes free markets and limited government intervention.
* He calls for:
    * **Eliminating or Reforming Farm Subsidies:**  Reducing or eliminating government subsidies for farmers.
    * **Rolling Back Regulations:**  Reducing or eliminating regulations on farmers and food producers.
    * **Promoting Free Trade:**  Expanding access to foreign markets for American agricultural products.
    * **Moving Food and Nutrition Programs:**  Transferring all USDA food and nutrition programs, including SNAP and WIC, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

**3.4 Specific Policy Recommendations <sup>(326)</sup>**

* **Eliminate Direct Payments:**  Eliminate direct payments to farmers, which are based on historical production levels rather than current market conditions. <sup>(328)</sup>
* **Reform Crop Insurance:**  Reform crop insurance programs to reduce government subsidies and to encourage farmers to take on more risk. <sup>(329)</sup>
* **Move Food and Nutrition Programs to HHS:**  Transfer all USDA food and nutrition programs to HHS. <sup>(332)</sup>
* **Reform SNAP:**  Reform SNAP by re-implementing work requirements, reforming broad-based categorical eligibility, re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan, and eliminating the "heat-and-eat" loophole. <sup>(333)</sup>
* **Return School Meals to "Original Intent":**  Eliminate the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows schools with high concentrations of poverty to offer free meals to all students. <sup>(335)</sup>
* **Reform Conservation Programs:**  Eliminate the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and reform conservation easements to make them less restrictive. <sup>(337)</sup>

**3.5 Conclusion: Restoring Freedom and Prosperity <sup>(340)</sup>**

* Bakst concludes by arguing that his recommendations are necessary to "restore freedom and prosperity" to American agriculture.
* He claims that a free market approach will lead to lower prices for consumers, higher incomes for farmers, and a more sustainable agricultural system.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 10 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for the USDA that prioritizes deregulation, reduced government spending, and a shift in focus away from addressing social problems like hunger and food insecurity. The chapter's recommendations could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly low-income families and farmers, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased hunger, environmental degradation, and a less competitive agricultural sector.

This chapter, along with Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, demonstrates a consistent pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to shrink the role of the federal government in addressing social and economic problems, even if it means harming vulnerable populations and undermining efforts to protect the environment and promote equality. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less just and less equitable society under a future conservative administration.
