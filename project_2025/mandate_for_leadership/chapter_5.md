title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 5 - Department of Homeland Security
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Homeland Security](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_5.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_5_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Ken Cuccinelli, Former Acting Deputy Secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Chapter 5 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agency created after 9/11 to consolidate various agencies responsible for protecting the homeland. Authored by Ken Cuccinelli, a staunch conservative and former Acting Deputy Secretary of DHS under President Trump, the chapter argues that DHS has become "bloated, bureaucratic, and expensive" and has "lost sight of its mission priorities." Cuccinelli proposes a radical plan to dismantle DHS and redistribute its functions to other departments, with a particular emphasis on creating a new, more powerful border and immigration agency focused on stricter enforcement.

The chapter's significance lies in its radical proposal to dismantle DHS, a major department with a broad mandate. This reflects a deep distrust of the agency and a belief that it has become ineffective and unaccountable. Cuccinelli's vision for a new, more powerful border and immigration agency with a hardline approach to enforcement raises serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for human rights abuses, a more restrictive and punitive immigration system, and a further erosion of civil liberties.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Dismantle DHS:** Cuccinelli's central recommendation is to dismantle DHS, arguing that it has failed to achieve its goals and has become too large and unwieldy. This reflects a broader conservative distrust of large government agencies and a preference for smaller, more focused entities.
* **Hardline Immigration Enforcement:** The chapter advocates for a hardline approach to immigration enforcement, including securing the border, strictly enforcing immigration laws, expanding detention and deportation, and eliminating various visa programs. This aligns with the broader conservative focus on border security and reducing illegal immigration.
* **State and Local Empowerment:** Cuccinelli supports empowering state and local law enforcement to participate in immigration enforcement, even if those jurisdictions have chosen not to do so. This reflects a conservative preference for decentralization and a belief that states are better equipped to address local issues.
* **National Security Focus:** The chapter emphasizes the national security implications of immigration, arguing that a secure border is essential for protecting the homeland from terrorism and other threats.
* **"America First" Approach:** Cuccinelli's recommendations reflect an "America First" approach to immigration, prioritizing the interests of American citizens over the rights of immigrants.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Mass Deportations:**  The creation of a powerful border and immigration agency with a focus on detention and deportation could lead to mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, separating families and harming communities.
* **Erosion of Asylum:**  Cuccinelli's proposals to restrict asylum eligibility and expedite removals could make it more difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to find safety in the United States.
* **Discrimination and Exploitation:**  Mandatory E-Verify and the punishment of "sanctuary cities" could lead to discrimination against immigrants and make them more vulnerable to exploitation by employers.
* **Increased Racial Profiling:**  Empowering state and local law enforcement to participate in immigration enforcement could lead to increased racial profiling and a decline in trust between police and minority communities.
* **Damaged U.S.-Mexico Relations:**  The chapter's hardline approach to immigration enforcement could damage relations with Mexico and undermine cooperation on border security and other issues.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 5 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a radical plan to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security and create a new, more powerful border and immigration agency with a hardline approach to enforcement. These proposals would likely lead to a more restrictive and punitive immigration system, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for human rights abuses and a further erosion of civil liberties.

This chapter highlights the deep divisions between conservatives and liberals on immigration policy. Cuccinelli's proposals represent a significant departure from the more humane and compassionate approach favored by Democrats, raising serious concerns about the potential for a more restrictive and punitive immigration system under a future conservative administration.
