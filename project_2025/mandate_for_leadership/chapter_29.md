title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 29
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Federal Election Commission](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_29.pdf)

**Author:** Hans A. von Spakovsky, Senior Legal Fellow and Manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at The Heritage Foundation

Chapter 29 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the independent agency responsible for enforcing campaign finance laws. Authored by Hans A. von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a prominent advocate for restrictive voting laws, the chapter argues that while the President's direct authority over the FEC is limited, a conservative President can still influence its direction through strategic appointments and by directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce campaign finance laws in a manner consistent with the FEC's interpretations. 

The chapter's significance lies in its attempt to downplay the potential for a conservative President to directly control the FEC while simultaneously outlining strategies to indirectly influence the agency's enforcement of campaign finance laws. This approach raises concerns among Democrats about the potential for a weakening of campaign finance regulations, a reduction in enforcement against violations, and a greater influence of wealthy donors and special interests in elections.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Limited Presidential Authority, Strategic Influence:** Von Spakovsky acknowledges the President's limited direct authority over the FEC due to its independent status but emphasizes that a President can still exert influence through appointments and by directing the DOJ's enforcement priorities.
* **Protecting First Amendment Rights:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of protecting First Amendment rights in the context of campaign finance regulation, arguing that the FEC and DOJ should not "infringe on protected First Amendment activity." This rhetoric could be used to justify a lax approach to enforcing campaign finance laws and to shield wealthy donors and special interests from scrutiny.
* **DOJ Deference to FEC:** Von Spakovsky argues that the DOJ should defer to the FEC's interpretations of campaign finance laws when making prosecution decisions, even if those interpretations are narrow or favorable to donors. This could limit the DOJ's ability to prosecute campaign finance violations, particularly in cases where the FEC is deadlocked or has failed to act.
* **Defending the FEC in Litigation:** The chapter criticizes Democratic FEC commissioners for refusing to authorize the agency's general counsel to defend the FEC in lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs, arguing that the President should direct the Attorney General to defend the FEC in such cases. This could be seen as an attempt to shield the FEC from accountability and could undermine the ability of citizens to challenge the agency's actions in court.
* **Maintaining the Bipartisan Structure:** Von Spakovsky strongly opposes efforts to change the FEC's structure, arguing that the current six-member, bipartisan commission is essential to prevent the agency from being "weaponized" for partisan purposes. This could perpetuate the FEC's current gridlock and inaction, making it difficult to address campaign finance abuses. Democrats may favor a more independent and less partisan FEC structure that would be more effective in enforcing campaign finance laws.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on protecting First Amendment rights and limiting the DOJ's role in prosecuting campaign finance violations aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47, which seeks to reduce government regulation and to protect conservative interests.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 17](./chapter_17.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Justice, complements Chapter 29 by advocating for a more politicized and less independent DOJ, which could be used to influence the enforcement of campaign finance laws.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 28](./chapter_28.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Federal Communications Commission, supports Chapter 29 by calling for a rollback of regulations on media companies, potentially making it easier for them to engage in political spending and to influence elections.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Weakening of Campaign Finance Laws:**  The chapter's recommendations could lead to a weakening of campaign finance laws, as the FEC and the DOJ become less likely to pursue enforcement actions against violations, particularly those committed by conservative groups and candidates.
* **Increased Influence of Wealthy Donors and Special Interests:**  A less rigorous enforcement of campaign finance laws could allow wealthy donors and special interests to exert greater influence on elections, potentially undermining democratic accountability and fairness.
* **Erosion of Public Trust in Elections:**  A perception that campaign finance laws are not being enforced fairly and impartially could erode public trust in elections and undermine confidence in the democratic process.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Undermining Campaign Finance Reform:**  Critics might argue that the chapter's recommendations would undermine campaign finance reform efforts and would allow wealthy donors and special interests to buy influence in elections.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 29 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative approach to the FEC that emphasizes protecting First Amendment rights, limiting the DOJ's role in prosecuting campaign finance violations, and maintaining the agency's current bipartisan structure. While some of these proposals, such as protecting free speech, may find bipartisan support, others, such as limiting the DOJ's role and maintaining the FEC's current structure, are likely to be more controversial and could raise concerns among Democrats about the potential for a weakening of campaign finance enforcement.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, highlights the conservative agenda to limit the role of government in regulating political activity and to protect the interests of wealthy donors and special interests. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the integrity of American elections, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less fair and less democratic political system under a future conservative administration.
