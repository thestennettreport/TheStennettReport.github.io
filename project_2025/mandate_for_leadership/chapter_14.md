title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 14
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Health and Human Services](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_14.pdf)

**Author:** Roger Severino, Former Director of the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Chapter 14 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), arguing that it has strayed from its mission of serving "all Americans from conception to natural death" and has become a tool for promoting a "woke" agenda under the Biden Administration. Severino, a former Director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS under President Trump, outlines a conservative vision for HHS that prioritizes protecting life, empowering patient choices, promoting traditional families, preparing for future health emergencies, and increasing transparency and accountability.

The chapter's significance lies in its comprehensive plan to reshape HHS according to a conservative ideology, potentially impacting access to healthcare, reproductive rights, and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. Severino's recommendations could lead to restrictions on abortion and contraception, a weakening of the Affordable Care Act, and a rollback of protections for transgender individuals and same-sex couples. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less inclusive and less equitable healthcare system under a future conservative administration.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Protecting "Life":** Severino emphasizes the need to protect the "fundamental right to life" from "conception to natural death," signaling a strong anti-abortion stance and a desire to restrict access to reproductive healthcare services.
* **Religious Freedom and Conscience Rights:** The chapter advocates for expanding religious freedom and conscience rights for healthcare providers, potentially allowing them to refuse to provide care that conflicts with their religious beliefs, even if it harms patients.
* **Patient Choice and Market-Based Solutions:** Severino promotes patient-centered, market-based healthcare reform that empowers individuals to make their own healthcare decisions and reduces government regulation. This aligns with the broader conservative preference for free markets and limited government intervention in healthcare.
* **Traditional Family Values:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of "stable and flourishing married families" and criticizes policies that support single parents, LGBTQ+ families, and other non-traditional family structures. This reflects a conservative social agenda that prioritizes a narrow definition of family.
* **Distrust of Government and Public Health Agencies:** Severino criticizes the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as being "centralized and politicized" and calls for a more decentralized and less intrusive approach to public health. This reflects a broader conservative distrust of government and a belief that individuals should be responsible for their own health.

* **Project 2025, Chapter 3:**  This chapter, focusing on central personnel agencies, complements Chapter 14 by advocating for weakening civil service protections and making it easier to fire federal employees who do not align with the President's agenda, potentially allowing for a purge of HHS employees who support abortion rights or transgender rights.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Restrictions on Abortion Access:**  The chapter's strong anti-abortion stance and its specific recommendations regarding the FDA and CMS suggest a concerted effort to restrict access to abortion care, potentially forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term and increasing maternal mortality rates.
* **Weakening of the Affordable Care Act:**  The chapter's advocacy for patient-centered, market-based healthcare reform and its criticism of the ACA suggest a desire to weaken or dismantle the law, potentially making health insurance less affordable and accessible for millions of Americans.
* **Discrimination Against LGBTQ+ Individuals and Families:**  The chapter's emphasis on "stable and flourishing married families" and its criticism of policies that support non-traditional families suggest a willingness to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals and families, potentially leading to a denial of healthcare services and benefits.
* **Inadequate Public Health Response:**  The chapter's criticism of the government's COVID-19 response and its call for a more limited role for the CDC in future health emergencies could lead to a less effective response to future pandemics, potentially putting public health at risk.
* **Undermining Scientific Research:**  The chapter's opposition to research using fetal tissue and embryonic stem cells could stifle important medical research and hinder the development of new treatments and cures for diseases.
