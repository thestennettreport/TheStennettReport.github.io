title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 6 Breakdown
---

**[Chapter 6: Department of State](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_6.pdf)**

**Author:** Kiron K. Skinner, Former Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of State, the agency responsible for conducting American diplomacy and representing the U.S. abroad. Skinner argues that the State Department is plagued by a "left-wing" workforce that resists conservative policies and operates with a sense of "independence" from the President. She outlines a plan to "reforge" the department into a "lean and functional diplomatic machine" that serves the President's agenda.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Political Control:** Skinner emphasizes the need for strong political leadership at the State Department and for staffing key positions with individuals who are aligned with the President's ideology. (Page 206)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a politicization of the foreign service and a decline in the quality and expertise of American diplomacy.
* **Aggressive Approach to Confirmations:** Skinner recommends placing political appointees in acting roles even before they are confirmed by the Senate, potentially circumventing the Senate's advice and consent role.
    * **Concern:** This could undermine the Senate's constitutional role in confirming presidential appointments and lead to a less qualified and more partisan State Department.
* **Confrontational Posture:** Skinner advocates for a more confrontational approach to foreign policy, particularly with respect to China and Russia.
    * **Concern:** This could escalate tensions with those countries and increase the risk of conflict.
* **"Sovereign Mexico" Policy:** Skinner calls for a "sovereign Mexico" policy, arguing that Mexico has "functionally lost its sovereignty to muscular criminal cartels."
    * **Concern:** This suggests a paternalistic and interventionist approach to Mexico, potentially undermining Mexican sovereignty and exacerbating tensions between the two countries.
* **Rejection of Multilateralism:** Skinner criticizes international organizations and agreements that she believes erode U.S. sovereignty and calls for withdrawing from or defunding those organizations. (Page 224)
    * **Concern:** This could weaken America's global leadership and undermine efforts to address transnational challenges like climate change and pandemics.
* **Promoting Conservative Social Values:** Skinner advocates for using U.S. foreign policy to promote conservative social values, such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.
    * **Concern:** This could alienate allies and partners who do not share those values and undermine America's moral standing in the world.

**Summary:**

Chapter 6 outlines a plan to transform the State Department into a more ideologically driven and less diplomatic agency that prioritizes the President's agenda over the expertise and experience of career diplomats. These proposals could have a destabilizing effect on international relations and undermine America's global leadership, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a more confrontational and less cooperative approach to foreign policy.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Alienating Allies:** The chapter's emphasis on a confrontational posture and the promotion of conservative social values could alienate allies and partners who do not share those views.
* **Undermining Diplomacy:** The chapter's focus on political control and the rejection of multilateralism could undermine the effectiveness of American diplomacy and weaken America's ability to build consensus and solve global problems.
* **Damaging America's Reputation:** The chapter's aggressive tone and its emphasis on using U.S. power to advance a partisan agenda could damage America's reputation in the world and undermine its moral leadership.

This chapter, like Chapter 4, highlights the stark differences in worldview between conservatives and liberals on issues of foreign policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the future of America's role in the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a more unilateral and less cooperative approach to international relations.
