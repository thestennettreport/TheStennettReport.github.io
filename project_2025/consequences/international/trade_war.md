title: Trade War 2.0 - A Recipe for Economic Disaster and Higher Prices for All Americans
---

### 1. OVERVIEW

**Title:** Project 2025: Trade War 2.0  <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./trade_war_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Analysis based on "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership," "Agenda 47," and related sources.

This analysis exposes the dangerous consequences of Project 2025 and Agenda 47's protectionist trade policies, particularly the proposed 10% universal tariff on all imports. This agenda, driven by a misguided belief in economic nationalism and a disregard for the interconnectedness of the global economy, would trigger a trade war, raise prices for American consumers, harm businesses, and ultimately undermine U.S. economic competitiveness. This page debunks the myth of protectionism and reveals the real-world pain it would inflict on ordinary Americans.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Protectionism as a False Promise:** Project 2025 and Agenda 47 peddle the false promise of protectionism, claiming that tariffs and trade barriers will protect American jobs and boost the economy. This is a dangerous myth, contradicted by decades of economic evidence and the experience of the Trump administration's trade war with China.
* **"America First" at All Costs:** The project embraces an "America First" economic nationalism that prioritizes domestic industries and workers, even if it means harming consumers, disrupting global trade, and undermining international cooperation.
* **Disregard for the Global Economy:** The agenda ignores the interconnectedness of the global economy, failing to recognize that trade wars harm all participants and that raising barriers to trade ultimately hurts American businesses and consumers.
* **Targeting China:** Project 2025 and Agenda 47 fixate on China as the primary economic threat, advocating for a decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies and a confrontational approach to trade. This ignores the benefits of trade with China and the potential for mutually beneficial economic cooperation.
* **Appealing to Economic Anxiety:** The project's protectionist rhetoric appeals to economic anxiety and fear of globalization, particularly among those who have been left behind by economic changes. However, this approach offers false solutions that would ultimately harm those it claims to help.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 The 10% Universal Tariff: A Tax on Every American**

The proposed 10% universal tariff on all imports is a central pillar of Project 2025 and Agenda 47's trade agenda. This policy, far from protecting American jobs, would act as a regressive tax on every American consumer, raising prices on everyday goods and services and disproportionately harming low- and middle-income families.

* **Higher Prices for Everything:** A 10% tariff would increase the cost of imported goods, leading to higher prices for consumers on everything from groceries and clothing to cars and electronics. This would reduce the purchasing power of American families, forcing them to cut back on spending or to go into debt to maintain their standard of living.
* **Regressive Impact:** The tariff would have a regressive impact, disproportionately harming low- and middle-income families who spend a larger share of their income on goods and services. Wealthier households would be less affected, as they have more disposable income to absorb the price increases.
* **Inflationary Pressures:** The tariff would contribute to inflation, as businesses pass on the increased costs of imported goods to consumers. This would further erode the purchasing power of Americans and could lead to a wage-price spiral, where rising prices lead to demands for higher wages, which in turn lead to even higher prices.

**3.1.1  Tariffs: A Hidden Tax on You**

Before we explore the devastating consequences of a 10% universal tariff, it's crucial to understand what tariffs are and who actually pays them.  

* **What is a Tariff?** A tariff is simply a tax imposed on goods imported from other countries. When a product enters the U.S. from overseas, the government can slap a tariff on it, making it more expensive for businesses to import.
* **Who Pays the Tariff?** While it might seem like foreign companies are the ones paying the tariff, the reality is that the cost is ultimately passed on to American consumers. Businesses that import goods have to pay the tariff, and they then raise their prices to cover that cost. So, when you buy a product that has been subject to a tariff, you're the one paying the extra cost in the form of a higher price.
* **A Hidden Tax:**  Tariffs are essentially a hidden tax on consumers. They're not as visible as income taxes or sales taxes, but they still take money out of your pocket and make it harder for you to afford the things you need.

**Think of it this way:** If a shirt made in China costs $10 and the government imposes a 10% tariff, the importer now has to pay an extra $1 for that shirt. They'll likely raise the price to $11 or more to cover the tariff and maintain their profit margin. So, when you buy that shirt, you're paying the extra dollar that goes to the government.

This hidden tax hurts everyone, but it disproportionately impacts low- and middle-income families who spend a larger share of their income on goods and services. It's a regressive policy that makes life more expensive for ordinary Americans while benefiting a select few domestic industries that are shielded from competition.

**3.2 Decoupling from China: Disrupting Global Supply Chains and Harming Businesses**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 call for "decoupling" the U.S. economy from China's, reducing trade and investment ties. This policy, driven by a fear of China's economic rise, would be costly and disruptive for American businesses and consumers:

* **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Decoupling would disrupt global supply chains that have been built up over decades, making it more difficult and expensive for American businesses to obtain the goods and components they need. This would lead to higher costs, production delays, and potential shortages.
* **Reduced Access to Markets:**  China is a major market for American exports, and decoupling would limit access to this market, harming American businesses that rely on exports to China.
* **Increased Costs for Businesses:**  American businesses that rely on imports from China would face higher costs, as they would have to find alternative suppliers or pay higher prices for Chinese goods. This would reduce their profitability and could lead to job losses.

**3.3 Retaliatory Tariffs: A Race to the Bottom**

Imposing tariffs on other countries inevitably invites retaliatory tariffs, leading to a downward spiral of trade restrictions that harm all participants:

* **Harm to American Exporters:**  Retaliatory tariffs from other countries would harm American exporters, making their products more expensive in foreign markets and reducing their competitiveness.
* **Trade Wars:**  A cycle of retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-blown trade war, disrupting global trade, harming economic growth, and increasing tensions between countries.
* **The Lessons of the Trump Trade War:**  The Trump administration's trade war with China provides a cautionary tale. The tariffs imposed by Trump harmed American farmers, manufacturers, and consumers, and they did little to achieve their stated goals of reducing the trade deficit or bringing back manufacturing jobs.

**3.4 Job Losses, Not Gains: The Myth of Protectionism**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 claim that protectionist policies will protect American jobs, but the evidence suggests the opposite:

* **Higher Costs for Businesses:**  Tariffs and other trade barriers increase costs for businesses, making them less competitive and potentially leading to layoffs or closures.
* **Reduced Consumer Spending:**  Higher prices for consumers lead to reduced spending, which can also lead to job losses in industries that rely on consumer demand.
* **Retaliatory Tariffs:**  Retaliatory tariffs from other countries can harm American exporters and lead to job losses in export-oriented industries.

**3.5 Stifling Innovation and Investment: A Less Competitive America**

Protectionist policies stifle innovation and investment, making American businesses less competitive in the long run:

* **Reduced Competition:**  Trade barriers reduce competition, allowing domestic companies to raise prices and become less efficient, as they face less pressure to innovate or to improve their products and services.
* **Limited Access to Technology:**  Restricting trade and investment with countries like China limits access to new technologies and ideas, hindering innovation and economic growth.
* **Uncertainty and Risk:**  Trade wars and protectionist policies create uncertainty and risk for businesses, discouraging investment and making it harder to plan for the future.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  Agenda 47's promises to "bring back jobs," "make America great again, again," and "stand up to China" align with Project 2025's protectionist trade agenda.
* **Project 2025, Chapters [4](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_4.md), [6](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_6.md), [12](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_12.md), [21](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_21.md), [22](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_22.md), [23](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_23.md), and [26](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_26.md):**  These chapters contain proposals that support the project's protectionist agenda, including increasing military spending, confronting China diplomatically, promoting fossil fuels, restricting foreign investment, weakening the IRS, and advocating for either strengthening or abolishing the Export-Import Bank.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Higher Prices for Consumers:**  A trade war would lead to higher prices for everyday goods and services, reducing the purchasing power of American families and disproportionately harming low- and middle-income households.
* **Job Losses and Economic Decline:**  Protectionist policies would harm American businesses, leading to job losses, reduced economic growth, and potentially a recession.
* **Weakened Global Leadership:**  America's retreat from free trade would undermine its global leadership and credibility, ceding economic power to China and other countries.
* **Increased Inequality:**  The benefits of protectionism would accrue primarily to wealthy individuals and corporations, while the costs would be borne by ordinary Americans, exacerbating income inequality.
* **Damaged International Relations:**  A trade war would damage America's relationships with its trading partners, undermining global cooperation and potentially leading to conflict.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Economic Harm:**  Critics argue that protectionist policies are economically harmful, leading to higher prices, job losses, and reduced economic growth.
* **Trade Wars Hurt Everyone:**  Opponents argue that trade wars are a lose-lose proposition, harming both the countries that impose tariffs and the countries that are targeted by those tariffs.
* **False Promise of Job Creation:**  Critics argue that protectionism does not create jobs in the long run and that it actually harms American workers by making businesses less competitive.
* **Undermining American Competitiveness:**  Opponents argue that protectionism makes American businesses less competitive in the global marketplace, as they face less pressure to innovate and to improve their products and services.

### 9. KEY QUOTES

* **"We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning." (Donald Trump, on trade)**  This quote reflects Trump's belief that the U.S. can win a trade war, despite the evidence to the contrary.
* **"Trade wars are good, and easy to win." <sup>(Donald Trump)</sup>**  This quote reveals Trump's simplistic and misguided view of trade policy.
* **"China is cheating us blind." <sup>(Donald Trump)</sup>**  This quote reflects the project's demonization of China and its use of inflammatory rhetoric to justify protectionist policies.
* **"We need to bring back manufacturing jobs to America." <sup>(Agenda 47, Economy)</sup>**  This quote appeals to economic anxiety and the desire to return to a bygone era of American manufacturing dominance.
* **"We need to protect American workers from unfair foreign competition." <sup>([Chapter 26](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_26.md))</sup>**  This quote reflects the project's protectionist ideology and its disregard for the benefits of free trade.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's protectionist trade agenda represents a dangerous threat to the U.S. economy and the well-being of American families. Their proposals, if implemented, would likely trigger a trade war, raise prices for consumers, harm businesses, and undermine American competitiveness. This agenda is driven by a misguided belief in economic nationalism, a disregard for the interconnectedness of the global economy, and a willingness to exploit economic anxiety for political gain.

This analysis highlights the urgent need to reject protectionism and to embrace policies that promote free trade, open markets, and international cooperation. A trade war would harm everyone, and it is essential to educate the public about the dangers of this agenda and to advocate for a more sensible and sustainable approach to trade policy.
