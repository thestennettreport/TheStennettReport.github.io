title: Scorched Earth - The Conservative Plan to Unleash Environmental Devastation - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 represent a direct attack on environmental protection, promoting policies that would accelerate climate change, unleash polluters, and jeopardize the health of our planet for generations to come.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Climate Change Denial:** The agenda dismisses the scientific consensus on climate change, promoting fossil fuels and hindering the transition to a clean energy future.
* **Deregulation as a Panacea:** It views environmental regulations as burdensome obstacles to economic growth, advocating for a wholesale rollback of regulations regardless of their impact on public health or the environment.
* **"Sound Science" as a Weapon:** It uses the rhetoric of "sound science" to challenge legitimate scientific research, particularly on climate change, often citing industry-funded studies or fringe theories.
* **State Control Over Environmental Protection:** Project 2025 advocates for shifting responsibility for environmental protection from the federal government to states, potentially leading to a patchwork of inconsistent regulations and a "race to the bottom" as states compete to attract businesses.
* **Prioritizing Corporate Profits:** The agenda consistently prioritizes the interests of corporations, particularly those in the fossil fuel industry, over the protection of the environment and public health.

**Why It Matters:**

This agenda threatens to accelerate the climate crisis, leading to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and widespread environmental damage. It would also increase pollution, harm public health, and jeopardize the planet's future for generations to come.

**Red Flags:**

* **Expanding Fossil Fuel Production:**  Opening up more public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, mining, and logging, prioritizing extraction over conservation.
* **Gutting the EPA:**  Reducing the EPA's budget and staff, limiting its authority, and appointing industry-friendly officials, effectively silencing the watchdog responsible for protecting our environment.
* **Rolling Back Environmental Regulations:**  Weakening or eliminating regulations on air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental harms, allowing polluters to operate with impunity.
* **Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement:**  Abandoning international efforts to address climate change, signaling a rejection of global cooperation on this critical issue.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's environmental agenda is a disaster in the making. It's a reckless gamble with the future of our planet, driven by ideology, greed, and a disregard for science. We must fight back against this agenda and demand action to protect our environment, address climate change, and ensure a healthy and sustainable future for all.
