title: Rigging the System - The Conservative Blueprint for Voter Suppression and Election Subversion - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 outline a dangerous plan to undermine voting rights and subvert democratic elections in America, making it harder to vote, eroding trust in the system, and potentially overturning unfavorable results.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **The "Big Lie" and Election Denialism:** The agenda perpetuates the "Big Lie" that the 2020 election was stolen, undermining trust in elections and creating a pretext for future attempts to overturn results.
* **Voter Suppression as a Strategy:**  It advocates for a range of voter suppression tactics, including stricter voter ID laws, reduced early voting and absentee voting, aggressive voter roll purges, and obstacles to voter registration, all of which disproportionately disenfranchise minority voters, young people, and low-income communities.
* **Politicizing Election Administration:** Project 2025 calls for appointing partisan election officials who are loyal to Trump and his agenda, potentially giving them the power to manipulate election rules, influence vote counting, and challenge results.
* **Weaponizing the DOJ:**  It suggests using the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute alleged voter fraud, even in cases where there is no evidence of wrongdoing, potentially intimidating voters and discouraging participation, particularly in communities of color.
* **Undermining Confidence in the System:**  By spreading misinformation about voter fraud and casting doubt on the integrity of elections, the agenda aims to undermine public confidence in the democratic process, making it easier to justify voter suppression measures and to challenge election results.

**Critical Quote:**

"We need to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat." <sup>(Donald Trump)</sup> - This quote, often repeated by Trump and his allies, reflects the agenda's strategy of using the rhetoric of "election integrity" to justify voter suppression.

**Why It Matters:**

This agenda poses a grave threat to the integrity of American democracy and the fundamental right to vote. If implemented, it could lead to a less representative government, a decline in voter participation, and an erosion of faith in our democratic institutions.

**Red Flags:**

* **Stricter Voter ID Laws:**  Disproportionately disenfranchising minority voters, students, and low-income individuals who are less likely to have government-issued IDs.
* **Reduced Early Voting and Absentee Voting:**  Making it harder for working people, seniors, and those with disabilities to vote.
* **Aggressive Voter Roll Purges:**  Removing eligible voters from the rolls, often based on flawed data or discriminatory criteria.
* **Politicized Election Officials:**  Giving partisan officials the power to manipulate election rules and influence outcomes.
* **Weaponized DOJ:**  Using the DOJ to intimidate voters and discourage participation, particularly in communities of color.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's attack on voting rights is a direct assault on American democracy. We must fight back against this agenda and defend the right to vote for all Americans. We must demand fair and accessible elections, protect the integrity of the voting process, and hold those in power accountable for their attempts to undermine our democracy.
