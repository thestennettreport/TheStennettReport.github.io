title: The Handmaid's Surveillance - Tracking Women's Bodies to Control Their Choices - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 create a chilling possibility: the government tracking women's periods to identify and potentially punish those seeking abortions, a dystopian scenario that aligns with their broader agenda of controlling women's bodies and erasing reproductive freedom.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Surveillance and Control:** The agenda promotes expanding government surveillance powers and reducing privacy protections, creating a framework that could be used to monitor women's reproductive health and target those seeking abortions.
* **Data Collection and Sharing:**  Project 2025 emphasizes increased data collection and sharing between government agencies, potentially creating a centralized database of personal information, including menstrual cycle data, that could be accessed and misused.
* **Weaponizing the Law:**  It advocates for a more aggressive and politicized Department of Justice (DOJ), which could be used to investigate and prosecute women suspected of seeking abortions, even in states where it is legal.
* **Emboldening Anti-Abortion Extremists:**  The project's anti-abortion agenda and its empowerment of conservative and religious groups could embolden anti-abortion extremists to use surveillance and intimidation tactics to target women and abortion providers.
* **Creating a Climate of Fear:**  The very possibility of government surveillance of women's periods would create a climate of fear and distrust, discouraging women from seeking reproductive healthcare and chilling their exercise of reproductive rights.

**Critical Quote:**

"We need to do everything we can to protect the unborn." <sup>(Agenda 47, Social Issues)</sup>

**Why It Matters:**

This potential for government surveillance of women's bodies represents a terrifying escalation in the attack on reproductive rights. It would erode privacy, create a climate of fear, and undermine women's trust in the healthcare system and their ability to make their own choices.

**Red Flags:**

* **Weakening HIPAA Protections:**  Reducing or eliminating privacy protections for reproductive health information, making it easier for the government to access and share this data.
* **Expanding Surveillance Powers:**  Increasing the government's ability to collect and analyze data on women's menstrual cycles, pregnancies, and abortion care.
* **Politicizing the DOJ:**  Appointing a loyalist Attorney General who is willing to use the DOJ to target women suspected of seeking abortions, even in states where it is legal.

**Bottom Line:**

The possibility of the government tracking women's periods to control their reproductive choices is a dystopian nightmare that could become a reality under Project 2025 and Agenda 47. We must fight back against this threat to women's privacy, autonomy, and fundamental rights.
