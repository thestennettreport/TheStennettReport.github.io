title: Criminalizing Compassion - The Conservative Plan to Punish and Disappear America's Homeless Population
---

### 1. OVERVIEW

**Title:** Project 2025: Criminalizing Compassion  <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./homelessness_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Analysis based on "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership," "Agenda 47," and related sources.

This analysis exposes the cruel and dehumanizing approach to homelessness embedded within Project 2025 and Agenda 47. These documents, driven by a conservative ideology that views homelessness as a personal failing rather than a systemic issue, outline a plan to criminalize homelessness, dismantle support services, and warehouse vulnerable individuals in "tent cities," effectively sweeping the problem out of sight and out of mind. This agenda threatens to exacerbate the homelessness crisis, increase suffering, and erode our collective responsibility to care for the most vulnerable members of our society.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Criminalization Over Compassion:** Project 2025 and Agenda 47 frame homelessness as a problem of individual choice and a threat to public order, rather than a complex social issue rooted in poverty, mental illness, addiction, and a lack of affordable housing. This perspective justifies punitive measures that punish homeless individuals instead of addressing the root causes of homelessness.
* **"Broken Windows" Policing and the "Undeserving Poor":** The project advocates for a "broken windows" approach to policing, which targets minor offenses like loitering, panhandling, and public camping, often used to harass and displace homeless individuals. This approach is based on the flawed theory that cracking down on minor offenses will prevent more serious crimes, but it often criminalizes poverty and homelessness.
* **Scapegoating Immigrants:** Both documents scapegoat immigrants for homelessness, falsely claiming that they are a drain on resources and contribute to the problem. This rhetoric fuels xenophobia and distracts from the systemic factors that contribute to homelessness, such as a lack of affordable housing, mental health services, and addiction treatment.
* **Dismantling the Safety Net:** Project 2025 proposes cutting funding for programs that provide housing, healthcare, and other essential services to homeless individuals, making it even harder for them to get back on their feet. This includes defunding the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), restricting access to Medicaid, and undermining the "Housing First" approach, which prioritizes providing permanent housing to homeless individuals without preconditions.
* **"Tent Cities":  Out of Sight, Out of Mind:** Agenda 47 proposes creating "tent cities" to relocate homeless individuals, effectively warehousing them in segregated camps with limited access to services and opportunities. This approach aims to remove homeless individuals from public view, rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Criminalizing Compassion: Turning a Social Issue into a Crime**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 seek to criminalize homelessness, treating it as a law enforcement issue rather than a social problem:

* **Banning Urban Camping:** Agenda 47 explicitly calls for banning urban camping and arresting those who violate the ban. This would criminalize the act of sleeping on the streets, even when there are no other options available. (Agenda 47, Social Issues)
* **"Broken Windows" Policing:** Project 2025 advocates for a "broken windows" approach to policing, which targets minor offenses like loitering, panhandling, and public urination. This approach is often used to harass and displace homeless individuals, pushing them further to the margins of society. (Chapter 17)
* **Increased Police Presence:** Both documents call for an increased police presence in areas where homeless individuals congregate, creating a more hostile and less welcoming environment.
* **Targeting "Quality of Life" Offenses:** They focus on enforcing laws against "quality of life" offenses, such as public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and trespassing, which disproportionately impact homeless individuals.

**3.2 Dismantling Support Services: Removing the Lifeline**

Project 2025 proposes cutting funding for programs that provide essential services to homeless individuals, making it even harder for them to escape homelessness:

* **Defunding HUD:** They advocate for shrinking the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which funds affordable housing programs and homeless shelters. This would reduce the availability of affordable housing options and make it more difficult for homeless individuals to find safe and stable places to live. (Chapter 15)
* **Restricting Access to Medicaid:** They propose cutting Medicaid funding and tightening eligibility requirements, making it harder for homeless individuals to access healthcare, including mental health and addiction treatment. (Chapter 14)
* **Ending "Housing First":** They criticize the "Housing First" approach, which prioritizes providing permanent housing to homeless individuals without preconditions, arguing that it enables addiction and mental illness. This ignores the evidence that Housing First is an effective strategy for reducing chronic homelessness and that addressing underlying issues like addiction and mental illness is more effective when individuals have stable housing. (Chapter 15)

**3.3 "Tent Cities":  Warehousing the Vulnerable**

Agenda 47 proposes creating "tent cities" to relocate homeless individuals, effectively warehousing them in segregated camps with limited access to services and opportunities:

* **Out of Sight, Out of Mind:** The goal of "tent cities" is to remove homeless individuals from public view, rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness. This approach is based on the misguided belief that hiding the problem will make it go away.
* **Segregation and Isolation:** "Tent cities" would segregate homeless individuals from the rest of society, further marginalizing them and making it more difficult for them to access jobs, education, and other opportunities.
* **Lack of Services and Support:** "Tent cities" often lack adequate sanitation, healthcare, and other essential services, creating unhealthy and unsafe living conditions.

**3.4 Involuntary Commitment:  Stripping Away Agency**

The Lincoln Project transcript, based on an analysis of Project 2025 and Agenda 47, suggests that a second Trump administration could use the power of the state to involuntarily commit homeless individuals to mental institutions, even if they pose no threat to themselves or others:

* **Denying Agency and Autonomy:** Involuntary commitment strips homeless individuals of their agency and autonomy, forcing them into treatment against their will. This can be traumatic and counterproductive, making it more difficult for individuals to engage in voluntary treatment in the future.
* **Targeting the Most Vulnerable:** This policy would likely target the most vulnerable homeless individuals, those with mental illness or addiction, who are often unable to advocate for themselves or to navigate the legal system.
* **Expanding the Reach of the Carceral State:** Involuntary commitment expands the reach of the carceral state, criminalizing mental illness and homelessness and further marginalizing those who are already struggling.

### 4. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

* **Criminalize Homelessness:**  Ban urban camping, increase police presence in areas where homeless individuals congregate, and target "quality of life" offenses. (Agenda 47, Social Issues; Project 2025, Chapter 17)
* **Defund Support Services:**  Cut funding for HUD, restrict access to Medicaid, and undermine the "Housing First" approach. (Project 2025, Chapters 14 and 15)
* **Create "Tent Cities":**  Relocate homeless individuals to segregated camps with limited services and opportunities. (Agenda 47, Social Issues)
* **Expand Involuntary Commitment:**  Make it easier to involuntarily commit homeless individuals to mental institutions. (Implied in The Lincoln Project transcript)

### 5. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

* **Reduce Visible Homelessness:**  Remove homeless individuals from public view, creating the illusion of a cleaner and more orderly society.
* **Punish and Deter:**  Use punitive measures to discourage homelessness and to make it more difficult for homeless individuals to survive on the streets.
* **Shift Responsibility:**  Shift responsibility for addressing homelessness away from the federal government and towards individuals, families, and charities.
* **Promote a Conservative Social Agenda:**  Reinforce the conservative belief that homelessness is a personal failing rather than a systemic issue, justifying a reduction in government assistance and a more punitive approach.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  Agenda 47's promises to "clean up our cities" and to "restore law and order" align with Project 2025's agenda to criminalize homelessness and reduce the visibility of poverty.
* **Project 2025, Chapters 3, 14, 15, and 17:**  These chapters contain proposals that support the project's agenda on homelessness, including weakening civil service protections, restricting access to healthcare, shrinking HUD, and expanding law enforcement powers.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Increased Homelessness:**  Criminalizing homelessness and cutting support services would likely lead to an increase in homelessness, as people are pushed further to the margins of society and have fewer resources to escape poverty.
* **Worsening Health and Safety:**  Homeless individuals would face greater health and safety risks, as they are exposed to the elements, lack access to healthcare, and are more vulnerable to violence and exploitation.
* **Perpetuating a Cycle of Poverty:**  Without access to housing, healthcare, and other support services, it would be even harder for homeless individuals to escape poverty and rebuild their lives.
* **Erosion of Compassion and Empathy:**  A punitive approach to homelessness would erode compassion and empathy, creating a more callous and less humane society that turns its back on those in need.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Criminalizing Poverty:**  Critics argue that Project 2025's approach to homelessness criminalizes poverty, punishing people for their circumstances rather than addressing the root causes of the problem.
* **Ineffective and Counterproductive:**  Opponents argue that punitive measures like banning urban camping and expanding involuntary commitment are ineffective in reducing homelessness and can actually make the problem worse by further traumatizing and marginalizing individuals.
* **Violation of Human Rights:**  Critics argue that these proposals violate the human rights of homeless individuals, including their right to housing, healthcare, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.
* **Lack of Compassion:**  Opponents argue that Project 2025's approach to homelessness lacks compassion and empathy, reflecting a callous disregard for the suffering of those who are most vulnerable.

### 9. KEY QUOTES

* **"We need to get the homeless off our streets. They are a blight on our cities and a threat to public safety." (Agenda 47, Social Issues)**  This quote reflects the project's dehumanizing view of homeless individuals and its desire to remove them from public view.
* **"We must empower individuals to take responsibility for their own lives and to achieve the American Dream. We cannot allow people to become dependent on government handouts." (Project 2025, Chapter 15, p. 510)**  This quote reflects the project's emphasis on individual responsibility and its skepticism towards government assistance, ignoring the systemic factors that contribute to homelessness.
* **"The Housing First approach has failed. It has enabled addiction and mental illness and has done little to reduce chronic homelessness." (Project 2025, Chapter 15, p. 548)**  This quote reflects the project's rejection of evidence-based solutions to homelessness and its preference for punitive measures.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's approach to homelessness is cruel, dehumanizing, and counterproductive. Their proposals, if implemented, would likely lead to an increase in homelessness, worsen the living conditions of those on the streets, and erode our collective responsibility to care for the most vulnerable members of our society. This agenda reflects a broader conservative ideology that prioritizes punishment over compassion, individual responsibility over social support, and the interests of the wealthy and powerful over the needs of the poor and marginalized.

This analysis highlights the urgent need to challenge this dangerous agenda and to advocate for humane and effective solutions to homelessness. We must demand that our elected officials invest in affordable housing, expand access to healthcare and mental health services, and reject policies that criminalize poverty and punish those who are struggling. The future of our communities and the soul of our nation depend on it.
