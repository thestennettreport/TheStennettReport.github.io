---

## Introduction

This page presents a detailed, speculative scenario of the first 100 days of a potential second Trump term, based on multiple sources including Project 2025 and Agenda 47. It combines various perspectives to provide a comprehensive overview of possible actions and their potential implications.

### The Lincoln Project's Ad
[The Lincoln Project](https://lincolnproject.us) launched an ad brilliantly layouting what the first 100 days could look like. I highly recommend checking it out on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NpLpOtFNFWg?si=0JUc788tPjRPYYYX).

## Day One: The Executive Onslaught

### Executive Orders
President Trump would likely sign a flurry of executive orders on Day One, reversing Biden-era policies and setting his agenda in motion:

1. **Reinstating Schedule F:** 
   - Makes it easier to fire federal employees
   - Enables a mass purge of the federal workforce
   - Replaces career civil servants with MAGA loyalists
   - Potentially undermines the expertise that keeps government running

2. **Restricting Transgender Rights:** 
   - Bans "gender affirming care"
   - Limits transgender rights
   - Could lead to increased discrimination and fear among transgender individuals

3. **Expanding School Choice:** 
   - Directs the Department of Education to promote school choice and parental rights
   - Could result in public schools losing funding
   - May provide parents with vouchers for private or religious schools

4. **Energy Independence:** 
   - Reverses environmental regulations
   - Promotes fossil fuel production
   - Potentially expands oil and gas drilling
   - May ignore or downplay climate change concerns

5. **Immigration Crackdown:** 
   - Reinforces border security
   - Restricts asylum
   - Could lead to increased border militarization
   - May result in more asylum seekers being turned away and families separated

6. **Loyalty Oath:** 
   - Implements a new oath of office demanding allegiance to Trump, not the Constitution
   - Represents a potential violation of democratic principles

7. **Birthright Citizenship:** 
   - Attempts to abolish birthright citizenship
   - Could potentially strip citizenship rights from millions of American-born children of immigrants

### Personnel Announcements
- Trump would likely announce key personnel appointments, including loyalists and ideologues who share his vision
- Expertise and experience may take a back seat to loyalty in these appointments

### Department of Justice Directives
- Transforms the DOJ into a potential tool for political revenge
- May target political opponents, including members of the January 6th Commission
- Could bring charges of treason and election interference against opponents

### Immigration Enforcement
- Initiates mass deportations of undocumented immigrants
- May sweep up legal residents and even some American citizens
- Potential for detention camps to hold those awaiting deportation

## Week One: The Legislative Blitz and Agency Directives

### Congressional Agenda
Trump would pressure Congress to pass legislation aligned with his agenda, including:

1. **Tax Cuts:** 
   - Implements significant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals
   - Could widen the gap between rich and poor
   - May starve essential government programs of funding

2. **Deregulation:**

   - Potentially compromises worker safety and environmental protections
   - Prioritizes corporate profits over public welfare

3. **Immigration Reform:** 
   - Restricts legal immigration
   - Pushes for border wall construction
   - May make family reunification more difficult
   - Could reduce opportunities for "dreamers" to find a path to citizenship

### Agency Directives
Trump would issue directives to federal agencies to begin implementing his policies:

1. **Department of Justice:** 
   - Investigates political opponents and "radical left" prosecutors
   - Potentially creates a climate of fear and political persecution

   - Could hinder efforts to combat climate change

3. **Department of Health and Human Services:**

   - Defunds Planned Parenthood
   - May limit women's reproductive rights and health services

## Month One: Consolidation of Power

1. **Purging Dissenting Voices:** 
   - Removes or sidelines career civil servants not aligned with his agenda
   - Replaces experts with loyalists, potentially compromising government effectiveness

2. **Controlling Information:** 
   - Limits press access
   - Uses social media to promote his message
   - Attacks and discredits independent media outlets
   - Weaponizes social media for propaganda and misinformation

3. **Challenging the Courts:** 
   - Appoints conservative judges
   - Challenges court rulings that disagree with his policies

## 100-Day Milestones

### Significant Policy Changes
Trump would aim to achieve significant policy changes within his first 100 days:

1. **Tax Cuts Enacted:**

## Potential Consequences and Concerns

1. **Erosion of Democratic Norms:** 
   - Trump's disregard for norms and willingness to challenge established institutions could undermine the rule of law and democratic accountability
