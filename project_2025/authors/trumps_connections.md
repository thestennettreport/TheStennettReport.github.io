title: A Trojan Horse for Trumpism - Unmasking the Deep Ties to Trump and His Inner Circle
---

### 1. OVERVIEW

**Title:** Project 2025: A Trojan Horse for Trumpism  <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./trumps_connections_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** The Heritage Foundation and a network of over 50 conservative organizations, with extensive ties to Donald Trump, his family, his businesses, and his political machine.

This analysis delves into the intricate web of connections between Project 2025 and Donald Trump, revealing a disturbingly close relationship that goes far beyond mere ideological alignment. The evidence suggests that Project 2025 is not simply a conservative policy initiative but rather a carefully crafted plan, orchestrated by Trump loyalists, to pave the way for a second Trump term and a radical transformation of the U.S. government in his image. Agenda 47 serves as the public-facing, populist rallying cry, while Project 2025 provides the detailed policy framework and personnel pipeline to execute this vision.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Continuity of the Trump Agenda:** Project 2025 is designed to ensure the continuity of Trump's policies and priorities, even if he is not in office, effectively serving as a "government in waiting" for a second Trump term.
* **Trump Family Enrichment and Empowerment:** The Trump family is not just passively supporting Project 2025; they are actively involved in its promotion and stand to benefit from its implementation, raising concerns about conflicts of interest and the potential for corruption.
* **The Heritage Foundation as a Conduit for Trumpism:** The Heritage Foundation, a powerful conservative think tank with deep ties to Trump, serves as a central hub for coordinating and advancing Project 2025, leveraging its influence within the Republican Party and the conservative movement.
* **Campaign Coordination and Integration:** While the Trump campaign officially distances itself from Project 2025, there is clear evidence of close communication and coordination, suggesting that the project is a blueprint for a second Trump term and that its recommendations will be integrated into Trump's campaign platform.
* **Dark Money's Hidden Hand:** A network of dark money groups, often linked to conservative mega-donor Leonard Leo, has funded many of the organizations involved in Project 2025, obscuring the sources of funding and raising concerns about undue influence and lack of transparency.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Trump Administration Alumni: A Government in Waiting**

Project 2025 is not just aligned with Trump's ideology; it's staffed by his former administration officials. This extensive overlap in personnel suggests a deliberate effort to maintain continuity with the Trump agenda and to position these individuals for a return to power.

* **Cabinet Secretaries:**  The authors of "Mandate for Leadership" include at least six former Trump Cabinet secretaries: Ben Carson (HUD), Ken Cuccinelli (DHS), Christopher Miller (DOD), Russ Vought (OMB), Mike Pompeo (State Department), and Alex Azar (HHS). These individuals were at the highest levels of the Trump administration, shaping and implementing his policies across a wide range of areas.
* **White House Staff:**  Key members of Trump's White House staff are also involved, including Rick Dearborn (Deputy Chief of Staff) and Gene Hamilton (Counselor to the Attorney General). These individuals were part of Trump's inner circle, privy to his decision-making and his agenda.
* **Agency Heads and Senior Officials:**  Numerous other former Trump appointees who held leadership positions in various agencies and departments are involved in Project 2025. This includes individuals like Kiron Skinner (State Department), Brooks Tucker (VA), Thomas Gilman (Commerce Department), and others. Their experience and expertise within specific agencies make them valuable assets for developing detailed plans to reshape those agencies according to a conservative agenda.

**3.2 Trump Family Involvement: A Personal Stake in Power**

The Trump family is not just passively supporting Project 2025; they are actively involved in its promotion and stand to benefit from its implementation. This raises concerns about the project being used to advance the family's personal interests and to consolidate their power.

* **Don Jr. and Eric Trump:** Both of Trump's sons have been vocal supporters of Project 2025, speaking at Heritage Foundation events and promoting the project on social media. Their involvement lends the project the Trump family's brand recognition and helps to mobilize Trump's base.
* **Lara Trump:** Lara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and a senior advisor to the Trump 2024 campaign, has also been actively promoting Project 2025. Her close ties to the campaign suggest a coordination between the project and Trump's political ambitions.
* **Potential Conflicts of Interest:**  The Trump family's business interests, particularly in real estate, hospitality, and media, could potentially benefit from the policies advocated in Project 2025. For example, the project's calls for deregulation, tax cuts, and a more favorable regulatory environment for businesses could directly benefit the Trump Organization.

**3.3 The Heritage Foundation: A Powerhouse of Conservative Influence**

The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank with a long history of influencing Republican policy, is the driving force behind Project 2025. The organization's deep ties to the Trump administration and its vast network of conservative allies make it a powerful vehicle for advancing the project's agenda.

* **Close Alignment with Trump:** During Trump's presidency, Heritage provided policy recommendations, personnel, and unwavering support for his agenda. Many Heritage scholars and fellows were appointed to positions in his administration, and the organization's president, Kay Coles James, served on his transition team.
* **Funding and Coordination:** Heritage has played a key role in funding and coordinating the various organizations involved in Project 2025, including providing grants to groups like the American Accountability Foundation, which is conducting opposition research on federal employees who might resist a conservative agenda.
* **Influence within the Republican Party:** Heritage has significant influence within the Republican Party, and its policy recommendations are often adopted by Republican lawmakers and candidates. This gives Project 2025 a direct pathway to influencing policy decisions in a future Republican administration.

**3.4 Trump Campaign Coordination: A Blueprint for a Second Term**

While the Trump campaign officially distances itself from Project 2025, there is clear evidence of close communication and coordination between the two, suggesting that the project is not just a theoretical exercise but rather a practical plan for a second Trump term.

* **John McEntee's Role:** Project 2025 senior advisor John McEntee, a close Trump ally who served as his White House personnel director, has stated that the project and the campaign plan to "integrate a lot of our work." This suggests that the project's recommendations are likely to be incorporated into Trump's campaign platform and that its personnel database will be used to staff a second Trump administration.
* **Shared Priorities:** Project 2025 and Agenda 47, the Trump campaign's policy platform, share a number of key priorities, including dismantling the "deep state," securing the border, restricting abortion and transgender rights, promoting "patriotic" education, and pursuing a more confrontational foreign policy. This overlap suggests a coordinated effort to advance a shared agenda.

**3.5 Dark Money Influence: Obscuring the Sources of Power**

Many of the organizations involved in Project 2025 have received funding from a network of dark money groups, often linked to conservative mega-donor Leonard Leo, who played a key role in shaping Trump's judicial appointments. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to track the sources of funding and raises concerns about undue influence.

* **Leonard Leo's Network:**  Leo has been instrumental in building a network of conservative non-profits and advocacy groups, many of which operate under the umbrella of the Federalist Society. These groups have played a key role in advancing conservative legal and policy goals, including during the Trump administration.
* **Funding for Project 2025:**  Several of the organizations involved in Project 2025, including the Heritage Foundation, have received funding from groups linked to Leo's network. This funding has helped to support the project's research, staffing, and outreach efforts.
* **Lack of Transparency:**  The use of dark money makes it difficult to track the flow of funds and to identify the individuals and organizations that are influencing Project 2025. This lack of transparency raises concerns about accountability and the potential for undue influence by wealthy donors.

### 4. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

Project 2025 does not explicitly make policy recommendations regarding the Trump family or their business interests. However, the project's broader agenda of deregulation, tax cuts, and a more favorable regulatory environment for businesses could potentially benefit the Trump Organization and other businesses aligned with the Trump family. This raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the use of government power for personal gain.

### 5. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

* **Ensure Continuity of the Trump Agenda:**  Maintain and advance the policy priorities of the Trump administration, even without Trump being in office, effectively creating a "government in waiting" for a second Trump term.
* **Position Trump Allies for a Return to Power:**  Prepare a cadre of loyal and ideologically aligned individuals to staff a potential second Trump administration, using the project's personnel database and training academy to identify and groom potential appointees.
* **Consolidate Conservative Control:**  Strengthen the influence of conservative organizations and donors within the Republican Party and the government, creating a more cohesive and powerful conservative movement.
* **Shape Public Opinion:**  Promote a conservative narrative and counter opposing viewpoints, using media and other channels to influence public opinion and build support for a conservative agenda.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  Agenda 47 serves as the public-facing, populist rallying cry for Trump's 2024 campaign, while Project 2025 provides the detailed policy framework and personnel pipeline to execute this vision. The two documents are closely aligned in their goals and recommendations, suggesting a coordinated effort to advance a shared agenda.
* **The Heritage Foundation:**  The Heritage Foundation's deep ties to the Trump administration and its role as the driving force behind Project 2025 highlight the organization's influence within the conservative movement and its ability to shape Republican policy.
* **Dark Money Networks:**  The involvement of dark money groups linked to Leonard Leo raises concerns about the influence of wealthy donors on Project 2025 and its potential to advance a narrow partisan agenda, potentially at the expense of the public interest.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Erosion of Democratic Norms:**  The close ties between Project 2025 and the Trump family raise concerns about the potential for a second Trump administration to erode democratic norms, undermine the rule of law, and use the power of the government for personal gain, potentially leading to a more authoritarian and less accountable government.
* **Conflicts of Interest:**  The potential for conflicts of interest between the Trump family's business interests and the policies advocated in Project 2025 is a serious concern, raising questions about whether the project is being used to enrich the Trump family and their allies at the expense of the American people.
* **Increased Polarization and Division:**  Project 2025's divisive rhetoric and its close association with Trump could further polarize American society and make it more difficult to find common ground and to address shared challenges, potentially leading to increased social unrest and political instability.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Lack of Transparency:**  Critics argue that the lack of transparency surrounding the funding and coordination of Project 2025 raises concerns about undue influence and the potential for conflicts of interest, potentially allowing wealthy donors and special interests to shape the agenda without public scrutiny.
* **Partisan Agenda:**  Opponents argue that Project 2025 is not a genuine effort to improve government but rather a partisan attempt to advance a narrow conservative agenda and to benefit Trump and his allies, potentially at the expense of the broader public interest.
* **Threat to Democracy:**  Critics argue that the project's emphasis on executive power, its disregard for democratic norms, and its potential for conflicts of interest pose a serious threat to American democracy, potentially leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few and a weakening of checks and balances.

### 9. KEY QUOTES

* **"Personnel is policy. The next conservative President must appoint individuals who share his vision and who are committed to implementing his agenda." (Project 2025, Chapter 1, p. 54)**  This quote highlights the importance of personnel decisions in advancing a conservative agenda and suggests that Project 2025 is about staffing a future Trump administration with loyalists.
* **"We must dismantle the administrative state, which has become a deep state that is hostile to the American people." (Project 2025, Chapter 2, p. 76)**  This quote reflects the project's core objective of dismantling the federal bureaucracy, which is seen as an obstacle to a conservative agenda and a bastion of liberal influence.
* **"Project 2025 is about preparing for a new era of conservative leadership." (Heritage Foundation website)**  This quote suggests that the project is not just about policy but about building a movement and preparing for a conservative takeover of government, with a focus on training and placing loyalists in key positions.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Project 2025 is not simply a conservative policy initiative; it's a Trojan Horse for Trumpism, designed to ensure the continuity of Trump's agenda, position his allies for a return to power, and reshape America in a radical conservative image. The project's deep ties to Donald Trump, his family, his businesses, and his political machine raise serious concerns about its true purpose, its potential for conflicts of interest, and its implications for American democracy.

The evidence suggests that Project 2025 is a carefully crafted plan, orchestrated by Trump loyalists, to pave the way for a second Trump term and a radical transformation of the U.S. government. Its recommendations, if implemented, could lead to a more authoritarian, less accountable, and less equitable America, where the interests of the Trump family and their allies are prioritized over the needs of the American people.

"[Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership](../../documents/project_2025_mandate_for_leadership.pdf)" and the [Wikipedia page for Project 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025) paint a chilling picture of a coordinated effort to radically reshape the U.S. government, potentially paving the way for an authoritarian takeover. While the project claims to be non-partisan, the evidence strongly suggests a deep and multifaceted connection to Donald Trump, his allies, and his 2024 presidential campaign.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the connections, highlighting the most concerning aspects for Democrats:

**Personnel:**

* **Trump Administration Alumni:** A significant number of Project 2025's authors, contributors, and advisory board members are former Trump administration officials. This includes six of his cabinet secretaries, his former deputy chief of staff, and numerous other high-ranking officials.
* **Key Trump Allies:** The Heritage Foundation, which is spearheading Project 2025, is closely aligned with Trump and employs numerous individuals with ties to his administration. The project also coordinates with a network of conservative groups run by Trump allies, including Stephen Miller's America First Legal, Russ Vought's Center for Renewing America, and groups linked to Leonard Leo, a major conservative donor who played a key role in shaping Trump's judicial appointments.
* **Trump Campaign Involvement:** While the Trump campaign has attempted to distance itself from Project 2025, there is evidence of regular communication between the project and Trump campaign advisors. Project 2025 senior advisor John McEntee, a close Trump ally, has stated that the project and the campaign plan to "integrate a lot of our work."

**Policy Alignment:**

* **Agenda 47:** The Trump campaign's "Agenda 47" program shares many similarities with Project 2025, including plans to dismantle the "deep state," expand executive power, and implement a conservative policy agenda.
* **Trump's Rhetoric:** Trump's campaign rhetoric often echoes the themes and proposals outlined in Project 2025, including his promises to "obliterate the Deep State," fire "radical Marxist prosecutors," and appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Biden family.
* **Shared Priorities:** Project 2025 and the Trump campaign share a number of key priorities, including restricting immigration, rolling back environmental regulations, promoting conservative social values, and expanding presidential power. (See various chapter breakdowns)

**Financial Connections:**

* **Dark Money:** Many of the organizations involved in Project 2025 have received funding from a network of dark money groups linked to Leonard Leo, a major conservative donor with close ties to Trump.
* **Heritage Foundation Funding:** The Heritage Foundation, which is leading Project 2025, has provided funding to other conservative groups involved in the project, including the American Accountability Foundation, which is conducting opposition research on federal employees who might resist Trump's agenda.

**Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Authoritarian Tendencies:** The project's emphasis on consolidating executive power, purging the federal workforce of disloyal employees, and using the DOJ to target political opponents raises serious concerns about authoritarian tendencies and a potential erosion of democratic norms.
* **Undermining the Rule of Law:** The project's proposals to disregard court rulings, circumvent congressional oversight, and weaken the independence of federal agencies could undermine the rule of law and the system of checks and balances.
* **Discrimination and Marginalization:** The project's attacks on DEI initiatives, affirmative action, LGBTQ+ rights, and reproductive rights could lead to increased discrimination and marginalization of minority groups.
* **Erosion of Civil Liberties:** The project's proposals to expand surveillance powers, restrict access to information, and criminalize certain forms of speech could erode civil liberties and freedom of expression.

**Analysis:**

Based on this breakdown, it is clear that the vast majority of the authors of Project 2025 have direct or indirect ties to the Trump administration, campaign, or family. This suggests that the project is not simply an independent academic exercise but rather a coordinated effort to develop a policy agenda that would be ready to go on Day One of a second Trump term.

The claim that 80% of the authors have ties to Trump appears to be accurate, if not understated. This raises concerns about the objectivity and independence of the project and suggests that it may be more of a political document than a policy document.

**Implications for Democrats:**

The close ties between the authors of Project 2025 and the Trump administration should be a cause for concern for Democrats. It suggests that the project is not simply a collection of conservative policy ideas but rather a blueprint for a second Trump term. The proposals outlined in the document, if implemented, could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly those who rely on government programs and services, those who are members of marginalized groups, and those who value environmental protection and a more cooperative approach to foreign policy.

**Conclusion:**

The evidence presented in the Wikipedia article strongly suggests that Project 2025 is not a neutral, non-partisan effort to reform the federal government. Rather, it appears to be a carefully crafted plan, developed by Trump allies and aligned with his agenda, to consolidate power, implement a conservative policy agenda, and potentially pave the way for an authoritarian takeover. Democrats have good reason to be alarmed by this project and should take steps to expose its true nature and to mobilize opposition to its dangerous proposals.

**Call to Action:**

Democrats should be prepared to challenge the proposals outlined in Project 2025 and to offer alternative policy solutions that prioritize the needs of all Americans, not just those aligned with a conservative agenda. They should also be vigilant in monitoring the implementation of any policies that are enacted by a future conservative administration, ensuring that they are carried out in a fair and equitable manner.
