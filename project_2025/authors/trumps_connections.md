title: Project 2025 - Unmasking the Trump Connection
---

"[Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership](../../documents/project_2025_-_mandate_for_leadership.pdf)" and the [Wikipedia page for Project 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025) paint a chilling picture of a coordinated effort to radically reshape the U.S. government, potentially paving the way for an authoritarian takeover. While the project claims to be non-partisan, the evidence strongly suggests a deep and multifaceted connection to Donald Trump, his allies, and his 2024 presidential campaign.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the connections, highlighting the most concerning aspects for Democrats:

**Personnel:**

* **Trump Administration Alumni:** A significant number of Project 2025's authors, contributors, and advisory board members are former Trump administration officials. This includes six of his cabinet secretaries, his former deputy chief of staff, and numerous other high-ranking officials.
* **Key Trump Allies:** The Heritage Foundation, which is spearheading Project 2025, is closely aligned with Trump and employs numerous individuals with ties to his administration. The project also coordinates with a network of conservative groups run by Trump allies, including Stephen Miller's America First Legal, Russ Vought's Center for Renewing America, and groups linked to Leonard Leo, a major conservative donor who played a key role in shaping Trump's judicial appointments.
* **Trump Campaign Involvement:** While the Trump campaign has attempted to distance itself from Project 2025, there is evidence of regular communication between the project and Trump campaign advisors. Project 2025 senior advisor John McEntee, a close Trump ally, has stated that the project and the campaign plan to "integrate a lot of our work."

**Policy Alignment:**

* **Agenda 47:** The Trump campaign's "Agenda 47" program shares many similarities with Project 2025, including plans to dismantle the "deep state," expand executive power, and implement a conservative policy agenda.
* **Trump's Rhetoric:** Trump's campaign rhetoric often echoes the themes and proposals outlined in Project 2025, including his promises to "obliterate the Deep State," fire "radical Marxist prosecutors," and appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Biden family.
* **Shared Priorities:** Project 2025 and the Trump campaign share a number of key priorities, including restricting immigration, rolling back environmental regulations, promoting conservative social values, and expanding presidential power. (See various chapter breakdowns)

**Financial Connections:**

* **Dark Money:** Many of the organizations involved in Project 2025 have received funding from a network of dark money groups linked to Leonard Leo, a major conservative donor with close ties to Trump.
* **Heritage Foundation Funding:** The Heritage Foundation, which is leading Project 2025, has provided funding to other conservative groups involved in the project, including the American Accountability Foundation, which is conducting opposition research on federal employees who might resist Trump's agenda.

**Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Authoritarian Tendencies:** The project's emphasis on consolidating executive power, purging the federal workforce of disloyal employees, and using the DOJ to target political opponents raises serious concerns about authoritarian tendencies and a potential erosion of democratic norms.
* **Undermining the Rule of Law:** The project's proposals to disregard court rulings, circumvent congressional oversight, and weaken the independence of federal agencies could undermine the rule of law and the system of checks and balances.
* **Discrimination and Marginalization:** The project's attacks on DEI initiatives, affirmative action, LGBTQ+ rights, and reproductive rights could lead to increased discrimination and marginalization of minority groups.
* **Erosion of Civil Liberties:** The project's proposals to expand surveillance powers, restrict access to information, and criminalize certain forms of speech could erode civil liberties and freedom of expression.

**Analysis:**

Based on this breakdown, it is clear that the vast majority of the authors of Project 2025 have direct or indirect ties to the Trump administration, campaign, or family. This suggests that the project is not simply an independent academic exercise but rather a coordinated effort to develop a policy agenda that would be ready to go on Day One of a second Trump term.

The claim that 80% of the authors have ties to Trump appears to be accurate, if not understated. This raises concerns about the objectivity and independence of the project and suggests that it may be more of a political document than a policy document.

**Implications for Democrats:**

The close ties between the authors of Project 2025 and the Trump administration should be a cause for concern for Democrats. It suggests that the project is not simply a collection of conservative policy ideas but rather a blueprint for a second Trump term. The proposals outlined in the document, if implemented, could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly those who rely on government programs and services, those who are members of marginalized groups, and those who value environmental protection and a more cooperative approach to foreign policy.

**Conclusion:**

The evidence presented in the Wikipedia article strongly suggests that Project 2025 is not a neutral, non-partisan effort to reform the federal government. Rather, it appears to be a carefully crafted plan, developed by Trump allies and aligned with his agenda, to consolidate power, implement a conservative policy agenda, and potentially pave the way for an authoritarian takeover. Democrats have good reason to be alarmed by this project and should take steps to expose its true nature and to mobilize opposition to its dangerous proposals.

**Call to Action:**

Democrats should be prepared to challenge the proposals outlined in Project 2025 and to offer alternative policy solutions that prioritize the needs of all Americans, not just those aligned with a conservative agenda. They should also be vigilant in monitoring the implementation of any policies that are enacted by a future conservative administration, ensuring that they are carried out in a fair and equitable manner.
