title: Project 2025 - A Conservative Blueprint for Disaster
---

### 1. OVERVIEW

**Title:** Project 2025: A Conservative Blueprint for Disaster <sup>([TL;DR Version](./detailed_breakdown_tldr.md))</sup>

**Author:**  The Heritage Foundation and a network of over 50 conservative organizations

"Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" is not merely a policy document; it's a comprehensive blueprint for a radical conservative takeover of the U.S. government. Spearheaded by [The Heritage Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation), a powerful conservative think tank with close ties to the Trump administration, this project represents a coordinated effort to dismantle the "administrative state," shrink the government, and reshape American society according to a conservative ideology.

The project's significance lies in its ambition, scope, and level of detail. It goes beyond simply outlining policy recommendations; it provides a roadmap for a conservative revolution, with specific plans for staffing, restructuring, and reorienting every major federal agency and department. This blueprint, if implemented, could have a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americans, potentially leading to a less equitable, less inclusive, and less democratic society.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Distrust of the "Deep State":** Project 2025 is fueled by a deep distrust of the federal bureaucracy, often referred to as the "deep state," which conservatives view as a self-serving entity resistant to change and accountable to liberal interests rather than to the American people. This distrust permeates the entire project, leading to proposals to weaken civil service protections, increase political control over agencies, and reduce the size and scope of government.
* **"Personnel is Policy":** The project emphasizes the importance of personnel decisions in achieving policy goals, arguing that a conservative President must appoint loyal and ideologically aligned individuals to key positions within the government. This "personnel is policy" philosophy is central to Project 2025's strategy, leading to the creation of a personnel database, a training academy for potential appointees, and detailed plans for staffing transitions.
* **Executive Power Maximization:** Project 2025 advocates for expanding presidential power and challenging limitations on executive authority, arguing that a strong and assertive President is necessary to overcome bureaucratic resistance and implement a conservative agenda. This reflects a broader conservative belief in a unitary executive and a distrust of checks and balances.
* **Free Markets and Limited Government:** The project champions free market solutions to economic and social problems, advocating for deregulation, tax cuts, privatization, and a reduced role for government in most areas of life. This reflects a core tenet of conservative ideology, but it ignores the potential for market failures and the need for government intervention to protect consumers, workers, and the environment.
* **Conservative Social Agenda:** Project 2025 promotes a conservative social agenda, including opposition to abortion, restrictions on transgender rights, support for traditional family values, and a rejection of what it perceives as "woke" ideology. This reflects the conservative movement's focus on cultural issues and its desire to reshape American society according to its values.
* **Confrontational Foreign Policy:** The project advocates for a more confrontational and less diplomatic approach to foreign policy, particularly with respect to China, arguing that the U.S. must assert its dominance and prioritize its own interests over global cooperation. This reflects a belief in American exceptionalism and a skepticism towards multilateralism.

**3.6 "Onward!": A Call to Action <sup>(916)</sup>**

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

"Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" is a comprehensive and ambitious effort by the conservative movement to reshape the federal government and American society. The project's recommendations, if implemented, could have a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americans, potentially leading to a smaller, less active government, a more market-driven economy, a more conservative social and cultural landscape, and a more confrontational foreign policy.

This project represents a fundamental challenge to the role of government in American life and raises serious concerns about the future of our democracy, our economy, our environment, and our values. Democrats, progressives, and all Americans who do not share the project's conservative vision should be prepared to challenge its proposals and to advocate for alternative policy solutions that prioritize the needs of all Americans, not just those aligned with a conservative ideology.
