title: Inside Project 2025's Secret Training Academy - A Chilling Glimpse into the Conservative Playbook
---

These leaked videos, obtained by [ProPublica and Documented](https://www.propublica.org/article/video-project-2025-presidential-training-academy-trump-election), expose the secretive training program designed to prepare an army of conservative loyalists to take over the federal government and implement a radical agenda. 

**What You'll See and Hear:**

These videos feature presentations and discussions by prominent conservative figures, including former Trump administration officials, Heritage Foundation experts, and leaders of other right-wing organizations. They offer a chilling glimpse into the minds of those who seek to control the levers of power in a future conservative administration.

**Key Themes:**

* **Confrontational Tactics:**  The videos emphasize aggressive strategies for challenging the status quo, dismantling the "administrative state," and implementing a conservative agenda, often bypassing traditional norms and democratic processes.
* **Loyalty Above All:**  Speakers stress the importance of loyalty to the President and his agenda, urging appointees to be "watchdogs" and to "rein in" the bureaucracy, potentially creating a climate of fear and silencing dissent within the government.
* **"Us vs. Them" Mentality:**  The videos foster a divisive "us vs. them" mentality, portraying liberals, the media, and career civil servants as enemies who must be defeated.
* **Manipulating the Media:**  Appointees are instructed on how to bypass mainstream media outlets, control the narrative, and use social media to promote a conservative message, potentially leading to the spread of misinformation and propaganda.
* **Undermining Democratic Processes:**  The videos reveal a disregard for democratic norms and a willingness to use executive power to circumvent Congress and the courts, potentially eroding checks and balances and the rule of law.

**Why This Matters:**

These videos are a wake-up call. They reveal the extent to which the conservative movement is actively preparing for a future administration, training a cadre of loyalists to implement a radical agenda that could have devastating consequences for our democracy, our environment, and our rights.

**Watch the Videos. Read the Transcripts. Get Informed.**

The future of our country is at stake. We must expose this agenda, educate the public about its dangers, and mobilize opposition to prevent it from becoming a reality.
