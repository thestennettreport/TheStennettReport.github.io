- [Video](../videos/1-conserving_america.mp4)/[Transcript](../transcripts/1-conserving_america.md)

This video, the first in Project 2025's Presidential Administration Academy series, lays the ideological groundwork for the entire training program. Matthew Spalding, Vice President of Hillsdale College and Dean of its Graduate School of Government, delivers a lecture outlining the core principles of American conservatism. He argues that these principles, rooted in natural law, limited government, individual liberty, and traditional values, are essential for "conserving America" and its "common purpose."

Spalding's presentation is not merely a historical overview; it's a call to action for aspiring conservative leaders. He frames the current political climate as a battle between conservative principles and the encroaching threat of progressivism, setting the stage for Project 2025's broader agenda of dismantling the "administrative state" and reshaping American society. The video's significance lies in its articulation of a distinctly conservative worldview that underpins the entire Project 2025 initiative.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Natural Law and Timeless Truths:** Spalding grounds his argument in the concept of natural law, asserting that there are enduring truths about human nature, rights, and government that are discoverable through reason and transcend historical context. This framework rejects moral relativism and provides a foundation for a conservative worldview, suggesting that these principles are not subject to debate or change.
* **Limited Government and Individual Liberty:** He emphasizes the importance of limited government and individual liberty, arguing that the government's role should be restricted to protecting individual rights and that excessive government intervention undermines freedom and prosperity. This theme aligns with the core conservative belief in individual responsibility and a skepticism towards government power.
* **Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law:** Spalding stresses the importance of constitutionalism and the rule of law, arguing that the Constitution is a framework for limited government and that it should be interpreted strictly to protect individual rights. This suggests a textualist and originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, often favored by conservatives.
* **American Exceptionalism:** He celebrates American exceptionalism, arguing that the United States is a unique nation founded on universal principles that have served as a beacon of liberty for the world. This reinforces the idea that America has a special role to play in the world and that its founding principles are superior to other political systems.
* **The Threat of Progressivism:** Spalding portrays progressivism as a dangerous ideology that rejects timeless truths, embraces unlimited government, and undermines individual liberty and traditional values. He frames progressivism as a threat to the American way of life and a force that must be countered by a resurgent conservative movement.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 The Miracle of American Democracy (0:00-2:00)**

Spalding begins by highlighting the peaceful transfer of power in America as a "miracle" in the eyes of the world, emphasizing the enduring nature of American democracy. He stresses that America is a nation in constant pursuit of its ideals, suggesting that complacency is a threat to its existence.

**Quote:** "In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving."

**3.2 The Essence of American Conservatism**

Spalding acknowledges the importance of policy debates but stresses the need to focus on shared principles and the "things we wish to conserve." He uses the example of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, who disagreed on many policies but shared fundamental beliefs about natural rights, the rule of law, and constitutional government.

**Quote:** "But those disagreements should not blind us to the things we hold in common, the more important and higher aspects of America's purpose, but also the things we wish to conserve."

**3.3 America's Unique Founding**

Spalding argues that America is distinct from other nations because it was founded on a set of universal ideas, not on ethnicity, religion, or shared history. He highlights the American Revolution as a revolution of ideas, centered on the principles of natural law and individual rights.

**Quote:** "But this country is is actually different. It was it was founded at a particular time, in a particular place, by a particular people, and it is that rich heritage of ideas, especially those stated in our core fundable documents, that define us still as a nation and as a people."

**3.4 The Turn to Nature: Grounding Rights in Natural Law**

Spalding traces the evolution of the American understanding of rights, starting with the colonists' initial appeals to their rights as Englishmen. He explains how the colonists shifted to grounding their claims in natural law, recognizing that rights are inherent in human nature, not granted by government.

**Quote:** "But they realized that that ground would not not be sufficient to fight a war against the British king, and so they considered other options in a debate at the First Continental Congress. Our charters, our rights before parliament, ultimately, they char chose to ground their claims upon nature, a more philosophically and more fundamental ground that was, a defense of rights behind Magna Carta, behind and beyond the rights of Englishmen to their rights as humans, and so they turned to nature as the ground for the claim of rights..."

**3.5 The Declaration's Enduring Principles: Equality, Rights, and Consent**

Spalding analyzes the Declaration of Independence, emphasizing the principles of equality, natural rights (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness), consent of the governed, and the right to alter or abolish government. He argues that these principles are the essence of American conservatism and what conservatives seek to conserve.

**Quote:** "Those ideas, that constitution, still are beacons for everyone in the world. They're still warnings for despots around the world, and they are still the brightest lights and the greatest inspiration for freedom and liberty in the world, but especially here at home."

**3.6 The Constitution: A Framework for Self-Government**

Spalding discusses the Constitution as a framework for limited government, highlighting its structure, delegated powers, and the Bill of Rights. He emphasizes the importance of decentralization, state and local control, and the role of civil society institutions in shaping good citizens.

**Quote:** "The institutions of civil society, churches, schoolrooms, families, those are the most important political institutions in our system. Those are the ones that play the most important role in shaping our characters and shaping ourselves to be good self governing citizens."

**3.7 The Challenge of Progressivism**

Spalding critiques progressivism, arguing that it rejects timeless truths, embraces unlimited government, and undermines individual liberty and traditional values. He sees progressivism as a threat to the American founding and its principles.

**Quote:** "The progressives had certain antifoundational principles at heart. They did not believe there were any truths or first principles and grounded their system on a sense of relativism."

**3.8 Prudence: Applying Principles in Practice**

Spalding introduces the concept of prudence as the essential virtue of statesmanship, arguing that it involves applying abstract principles to concrete situations in a wise and effective manner. He emphasizes the need for conservatives to be both principled and pragmatic, adapting their approaches to changing circumstances while remaining true to their core values.

**Quote:** "Conservatism should not be approached as itself a set of doctrinal ideas that never change. Our policy disagreements are just that, things that change depending on the circumstances."

**3.9 A Call for Conservative Renewal**

Spalding concludes with a call for a "conservative renaissance" in America, urging a rediscovery of the principles of the Founding Fathers and a rejection of progressive ideology. He argues that conservatism is the best way to preserve American liberty, prosperity, and its unique place in the world.

**Quote:** "So what we need in the end is a rediscovery of conservatism, a a reborn conservatism, a conservatism that is grounded in the principles of the declaration of independence and the constitution of the United States."

### 4. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

While the video primarily focuses on establishing the ideological framework for Project 2025, it implicitly supports the project's broader agenda of limited government, individual liberty, free markets, and a return to traditional values.

### 5. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

* **Establish a Conservative Worldview:** Lay a strong ideological foundation for Project 2025, grounding it in natural law, constitutionalism, and American exceptionalism.
* **Define the Enemy:** Portray progressivism as a dangerous ideology that threatens American freedom and prosperity, creating a clear "us vs. them" dynamic.
* **Inspire Conservative Action:** Motivate conservatives to embrace Project 2025 and work to implement its agenda, framing it as a necessary step to "conserve America" and its founding principles.

### 6. HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Spalding uses historical references extensively throughout the video, drawing on the American Revolution, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the writings of the Founding Fathers to support his argument that American conservatism is rooted in timeless principles that must be preserved. He also discusses the rise of progressivism in the early 20th century as a departure from these principles and a threat to American liberty.

These historical references serve to legitimize Project 2025 by connecting it to a revered past and by framing it as a continuation of the American founding project. By invoking the Founding Fathers and their ideas, Spalding seeks to imbue the project with a sense of authority and tradition.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Increased Political Polarization:** The video's framing of conservatism as the only solution to America's problems and its portrayal of progressivism as a dangerous ideology could further polarize American politics, making it more difficult to find common ground and address shared challenges.
* **Erosion of Trust in Government:** The video's distrust of the "administrative state" and its emphasis on "reining in" government agencies could erode public trust in government institutions and undermine the legitimacy of the civil service.
* **Emboldening of the Far Right:** The video's rhetoric could embolden far-right groups and individuals who share its vision of a conservative revolution, potentially leading to increased political violence and instability.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Historical Revisionism:** Critics might argue that the video engages in historical revisionism by presenting a romanticized view of the Founding Fathers and their vision for America, ignoring the complexities of history and the fact that the Founders themselves disagreed on many issues.
* **Ignoring the Successes of Liberal Policies:** Opponents might argue that the video ignores the successes of liberal policies in areas such as social welfare, environmental protection, and civil rights, suggesting that only conservative policies can solve America's problems.
* **Promoting a Divisive Agenda:** Critics might argue that the video's emphasis on conservative values and its attacks on progressivism promote a divisive agenda that could further polarize American society and undermine efforts to find common ground.

### 10. RHETORICAL ANALYSIS

Spalding's presentation is characterized by a combination of historical narrative, philosophical argumentation, and emotional appeals. He uses vivid language, historical anecdotes, and appeals to patriotism and traditional values to create a compelling narrative that resonates with a conservative audience.

### 11. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

The "Conserving America" video is more than just an introductory lecture; it's a foundational text for Project 2025. It lays out the core ideological framework that underpins the entire project, justifying its radical agenda and mobilizing support for its implementation. By framing conservatism as the only path to restoring America's greatness and progressivism as a dangerous threat, Spalding seeks to energize a conservative movement and to prepare the ground for a sweeping transformation of American society and government.

This video is a stark reminder of the deep ideological divisions within American society and the challenges of finding common ground in an increasingly polarized political landscape. It highlights the importance of understanding the conservative worldview and its implications for policy and governance. For those who do not share this worldview, the video serves as a warning of the potential consequences of a conservative resurgence and a call to action to defend democratic values and institutions.
