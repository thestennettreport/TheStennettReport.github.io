**Runtime:** 28:12

**Speaker:** Ben Friedmann

**YouTube:** [Project 2025 Private Training Video: Social Media Messaging](https://youtu.be/D4HcW29sxcA) ([Transcript](../transcripts/23-best_practices_in_social_media.md))

This video, part of Project 2025's Presidential Administration Academy, focuses on how conservative political appointees can effectively use social media to advance their policy goals and shape public opinion. Ben Friedmann, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Digital Strategy at the U.S. State Department under President Trump, delivers the presentation, offering a blend of practical advice and ideological framing. He emphasizes the importance of crafting compelling narratives, targeting specific audiences, and bypassing traditional media gatekeepers, all while subtly promoting a conservative worldview and a distrust of mainstream media.

The video's significance lies in its recognition of the power of social media in the modern political landscape and its attempt to equip conservative appointees with the tools and strategies to weaponize social media for partisan purposes. This approach raises concerns about the potential for spreading misinformation, manipulating public opinion, and further polarizing the political discourse.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: The Power of Social Media**

Friedmann begins by highlighting the transformative power of social media in the modern world, arguing that it has fundamentally changed how people consume information, interact with each other, and engage in political discourse. He emphasizes that social media is a powerful tool that can be used to shape public opinion, influence policy debates, and mobilize support for causes.

**Quote:** "Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate. It's a powerful tool that can be used to reach a massive audience and to shape the national conversation."

**3.2 Crafting Compelling Narratives: "Stories, Not Just Facts"**

Friedmann stresses the importance of crafting compelling narratives that resonate with target audiences, arguing that facts and data alone are not enough to persuade people. He encourages appointees to use storytelling, emotional appeals, and visual imagery to connect with voters and to make their messages more memorable and persuasive.

* **Storytelling:**  He suggests that people are more likely to remember and be moved by stories than by dry facts and figures.
* **Emotional Appeals:**  He encourages appointees to appeal to people's emotions, such as fear, anger, hope, and patriotism, to make their messages more impactful.
* **Visual Imagery:**  He emphasizes the importance of using strong visuals, such as images, videos, and infographics, to capture attention and to make messages more shareable.

**Quote:** "People don't just want facts; they want stories. They want to be moved, they want to be inspired, and they want to feel connected to something bigger than themselves."

**3.3 Targeting Specific Audiences: "Know Your Audience"**

Friedmann stresses the need to target specific audiences with tailored messages, using social media platforms and tools to reach different demographic groups, ideological segments, and geographic regions. He argues that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to social media is ineffective and that appointees need to understand their target audience and craft messages that resonate with their values, beliefs, and interests.

* **Demographics:**  He suggests that different demographic groups, such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity, may respond differently to different messages.
* **Ideology:**  He argues that it's important to tailor messages to different ideological groups, such as conservatives, liberals, and independents.
* **Geography:**  He notes that different geographic regions may have different concerns and priorities.

**Quote:** "You need to know your audience. Who are you trying to reach? What are their values? What are their concerns? What kind of language resonates with them?"

**3.4 Bypassing Traditional Media: "Go Direct"**

Friedmann implicitly encourages appointees to bypass traditional media outlets, which are often perceived as hostile to conservative viewpoints, and to use social media to communicate directly with the public. He suggests that social media allows appointees to control their message, to avoid being "filtered" by the media, and to reach a wider audience.

**Quote:** "You don't need the mainstream media anymore. You can go direct to the people through social media."

**3.5 Best Practices for Social Media**

Friedmann offers several best practices for using social media effectively:

* **Be Authentic:**  He encourages appointees to be authentic and genuine in their social media presence, sharing their personal stories and connecting with people on a human level.
* **Be Consistent:**  He stresses the importance of being consistent in posting content and engaging with followers.
* **Be Responsive:**  He encourages appointees to be responsive to comments and questions from followers, building relationships and fostering a sense of community.
* **Use a Variety of Content:**  He suggests using a variety of content, including text, images, videos, and live streams, to keep followers engaged.
* **Measure Your Results:**  He encourages appointees to track their social media metrics, such as reach, engagement, and website traffic, to assess the effectiveness of their efforts.

**3.6 Conclusion: "Winning the Information War"**

Friedmann concludes by arguing that social media is a critical battleground in the "information war" and that conservatives must be strategic and effective in using it to advance their agenda. He encourages appointees to embrace social media, to learn the best practices, and to use it to "win hearts and minds."

**Quote:** "Social media is a powerful weapon in the information war. We need to use it wisely and strategically to win hearts and minds and to advance our agenda."

* **Shape Public Opinion:**  Use social media to shape public opinion in favor of conservative policies and to counter opposing viewpoints.
* **Mobilize Conservative Voters:**  Engage and mobilize conservative voters through social media, encouraging them to contact their elected officials, to participate in rallies and protests, and to vote for conservative candidates.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Increased Spread of Misinformation:**  The emphasis on crafting compelling narratives and targeting specific audiences could lead to the spread of misinformation and propaganda, as appointees may prioritize persuasion over accuracy.

* **Erosion of Trust in Institutions:**  The distrust of traditional media and the emphasis on controlling the narrative could erode public trust in institutions, as people become more skeptical of information from official sources.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Manipulation and Propaganda:**  Critics might argue that the video's recommendations encourage manipulation and propaganda, prioritizing persuasion over truth and accuracy.
* **Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles:**  Opponents might argue that targeting specific audiences with tailored messages could create echo chambers and filter bubbles, reinforcing existing biases and making it more difficult for people to engage with diverse perspectives.
