### 1. VIDEO OVERVIEW
**Title:** "Building Winning Coalitions to Advance Policy"

**Runtime:** 35:37

**Speaker:** Paul Teller and Sarah Makin

**YouTube:** [Project 2025 Private Training Video: Coalition Building](https://youtu.be/eI_5tAtdJP0) ([Transcript](../transcripts/22-building_winning_coalitions.md))

This video, part of Project 2025's Presidential Administration Academy, focuses on how conservative political appointees can effectively leverage outside advocacy groups to advance a conservative policy agenda. Paul Teller, a former senior aide in the Office of the Vice President during the Trump administration, and Sarah Makin, a former deputy assistant to the President and director of outreach in the Office of the Vice President under Trump, deliver the presentation. They emphasize the importance of building relationships with conservative organizations, coordinating messaging, and mobilizing grassroots support to pressure Congress and influence policy outcomes.

The video's significance lies in its explicit call for a coordinated strategy between the executive branch and outside conservative groups, suggesting a blurring of lines between government and partisan activism. This approach raises concerns about the potential for undue influence by special interest groups, a prioritization of narrow ideological agendas over the broader public interest, and a further polarization of American politics.

### 4. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

The video does not focus on specific policy recommendations but rather on providing general guidance and advice to potential political appointees. However, it implicitly supports the broader Project 2025 agenda of advancing a conservative policy agenda across all areas of government, particularly on issues such as abortion, gun rights, religious freedom, and deregulation.

### 5. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

### 6. HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Teller and Makin draw on their experience in the Trump administration, highlighting the importance of working with outside groups to advance a conservative agenda in a highly polarized political environment. They implicitly criticize previous administrations, suggesting that they were not sufficiently effective in mobilizing conservative support or in countering liberal opposition.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Increased Influence of Special Interests:**  The emphasis on building coalitions with outside advocacy groups could lead to an increase in the influence of special interests in government, potentially prioritizing narrow ideological agendas over the broader public interest.

Teller and Makin present themselves as experienced insiders who understand the complexities of Washington, D.C., and who can provide valuable guidance on how to navigate the political process and achieve policy victories.
