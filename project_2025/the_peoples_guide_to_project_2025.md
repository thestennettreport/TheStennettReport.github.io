title: The People's Guide to Project 2025 - A Detailed Breakdown
---

**Framing the Narrative:**

This guide, published by Democracy Forward, frames Project 2025 as a "far-right playbook" that threatens to "take our country backward." It emphasizes the potential negative consequences of the project's proposals for ordinary Americans, particularly in areas like worker rights, social safety net programs, civil rights, and environmental protection.

**Key Arguments:**

* **Systemic and Ruthless Plan:** The guide portrays Project 2025 as a "systemic, ruthless plan" to undermine the quality of life for millions of Americans and to prioritize special interests and ideological extremism over people.
* **Real and Immediate Threat:** The guide stresses that the threats posed by Project 2025 are not hypothetical but real and imminent. It highlights the Heritage Foundation's intention to implement its agenda through executive action, bypassing Congress and potentially the courts.
* **Anti-Democratic and Harmful:** The guide characterizes Project 2025 as an "anti-democratic" effort that would harm workers, families, communities, and the environment. It emphasizes the project's potential to roll back progress on civil rights, weaken the social safety net, and exacerbate inequality.

**New Information and Concerns:**

While much of the "People's Guide" echoes the concerns raised in our previous chapter breakdowns, it also highlights some new information and concerns:

* **Quantified Impacts:** The guide quantifies the potential negative impacts of Project 2025, claiming that it could lead to 4.3 million workers losing overtime protections, 40 million people having their food assistance reduced, 220,000 American jobs being lost, and over 1 million children losing access to Head Start. These numbers provide a stark illustration of the potential human cost of the project's proposals.
* **Focus on Executive Action:** The guide emphasizes the Heritage Foundation's intention to implement its agenda through executive action, bypassing Congress and potentially the courts. This raises concerns about the potential for abuses of power and a weakening of democratic norms and checks and balances.
* **Legal Challenges:** The guide acknowledges that many of Project 2025's proposals are unlawful but expresses concern that legal challenges may not be successful given the conservative tilt of the current court system. This highlights the importance of mobilizing public opposition to the project and advocating for legislative and judicial reforms to protect democratic values and institutions.

**Specific Examples of Potential Harms:**

The "People's Guide" provides several specific examples of how Project 2025's proposals could harm ordinary Americans:

* **Cutting Overtime Pay:** The guide highlights the potential for millions of workers to lose overtime protections if the Department of Labor lowers the overtime threshold, as recommended in Project 2025.
* **Restricting Access to Food Assistance:** The guide warns that millions of people could lose access to food assistance if Project 2025's recommendations to reimpose work requirements and re-evaluate the Thrifty Food Plan are implemented.
* **Eliminating Head Start:** The guide criticizes the proposal to eliminate Head Start, arguing that it would harm over 1 million low-income children and their families.
* **Limiting Disability Benefits for Veterans:** The guide expresses concern that Project 2025's recommendations to limit the number of health conditions that qualify veterans for disability benefits could harm those who rely on those benefits.
* **Eliminating Funding for Public Transportation:** The guide criticizes the proposal to eliminate the Capital Investment Grants program, arguing that it would make it harder for people without cars to access transportation.
* **Exposing Foster Children to Discrimination:** The guide warns that repealing a regulation that protects foster youth from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity could harm LGBTQ+ youth in foster care.
* **Weakening Environmental Protections:** The guide criticizes the proposals to expand offshore oil and gas drilling, disband NOAA, and shift climate-related funding to state regulators, arguing that these actions would harm the environment and exacerbate climate change.

**Call to Action:**

The "People's Guide" concludes with a call to action, urging readers to learn more about Project 2025, to share the guide with others, and to get involved in resisting its agenda. It emphasizes the importance of building a "bold, inclusive democracy for all people" and provides a link to Democracy Forward's website for more information and resources.

**Overall Assessment:**

The "People's Guide to Project 2025" provides a valuable counter-narrative to the Heritage Foundation's vision for a conservative America. It highlights the potential harms of the project's proposals for ordinary Americans and emphasizes the need for public engagement and political action to protect democratic values and institutions. By quantifying the potential impacts of Project 2025 and focusing on its most controversial elements, the guide aims to mobilize opposition and to build support for alternative policy solutions that prioritize the needs of all Americans. 

This guide, combined with our previous chapter breakdowns, provides a comprehensive picture of both the conservative agenda outlined in Project 2025 and the progressive critique of that agenda. By understanding both sides of this debate, we can be better equipped to engage in informed discussions about the future of our country and to advocate for policies that promote a more just, equitable, and sustainable society for all.
