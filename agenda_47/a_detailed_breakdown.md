title: Agenda 47 - A Detailed Breakdown
---

**What is Agenda 47?**

Agenda 47, Donald Trump's policy platform for his 2024 presidential campaign, is a collection of proposals presented primarily through videos on his campaign website. It aims to provide a "comprehensive and detailed look at what President Trump will do if he returns to the White House." The agenda targets Republican primary voters and reflects a focus on expanding presidential power, enacting conservative social policies, and taking a hardline stance on immigration and national security.

**Key Themes & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Expansion of Presidential Power:** Agenda 47 proposes several measures to increase presidential authority, including reissuing Schedule F to make it easier to fire federal employees, restoring impoundment to control federal spending, and bringing independent regulatory agencies under presidential control. These proposals raise concerns about potential abuses of power and a weakening of checks and balances.
* **Conservative Social Agenda:** The agenda includes several proposals aimed at advancing a conservative social agenda, such as banning critical race theory and "gender ideology" in schools, restricting transgender rights, and promoting traditional family values. These proposals raise concerns about discrimination, censorship, and the imposition of a narrow religious worldview.
* **Hardline Immigration Policies:** Agenda 47 calls for a crackdown on illegal immigration, including ending birthright citizenship, building a border wall, deploying the National Guard to cities, and imposing the death penalty for human traffickers. These proposals raise concerns about human rights abuses, racial profiling, and a more punitive and less compassionate immigration system.
* **Confrontational Foreign Policy:** The agenda advocates for a more confrontational foreign policy, including withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, renegotiating NATO's purpose, and taking a hard line against China and Iran. These proposals raise concerns about escalating international tensions and undermining global cooperation.

**Detailed Breakdown of Key Policy Areas:**

**1. Economy:**

* **Protectionist Trade Policies:** Agenda 47 proposes universal baseline tariffs on most foreign products, revoking China's Most Favored Nation status, and banning federal contracts for companies that outsource to China. These protectionist measures raise concerns about trade wars, higher prices for consumers, and harm to American businesses that rely on global supply chains.
* **Energy Independence:** The agenda calls for ending "Biden's war on American energy" by eliminating regulations, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and approving all oil infrastructure projects. This focus on fossil fuels raises concerns about climate change and environmental degradation.
* **Rebuilding the Auto Industry:** The agenda proposes to "save America's auto industry" by rolling back fuel economy standards, eliminating EV subsidies, and demanding full compliance with USMCA's regional content requirements. This could undermine efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the transition to electric vehicles.

**2. Education:**

* **Banning Critical Race Theory and "Gender Ideology":** Agenda 47 proposes cutting federal funding for schools that teach critical race theory or "gender ideology," directing the DOJ to investigate schools that engage in "race-based discrimination," and keeping "men out of women's sports." These proposals raise concerns about censorship, discrimination, and the imposition of a narrow worldview on education.
* **Empowering Parents:** The agenda emphasizes parental rights in education, calling for greater transparency and control over curriculum, school budgets, and health services. This could lead to the exclusion of certain topics and perspectives from schools and could undermine efforts to promote diversity and inclusion.
* **School Choice:** Agenda 47 advocates for universal school choice, allowing parents to use public funds to send their children to private or religious schools. This could divert resources away from public schools and exacerbate inequality in education.
* **Reforming Higher Education:** The agenda proposes using the college accreditation system to "reclaim" universities from the "radical Left," firing "radical Left accreditors," and imposing new standards that emphasize patriotism, free speech, and traditional values. This could undermine academic freedom and institutional autonomy.

**3. Expansion of Presidential Powers:**

* **Schedule F:** Agenda 47 proposes reissuing Schedule F, which would make it easier to fire federal employees, potentially allowing for a purge of career civil servants based on their political views.
* **Impoundment:** The agenda calls for restoring impoundment, giving the President greater control over federal spending, potentially allowing him to defund programs that he disagrees with, regardless of Congressional appropriations.
* **Control over Independent Agencies:** The agenda proposes bringing independent regulatory agencies, such as the FCC and FTC, under presidential authority, potentially undermining their independence and making them more susceptible to political pressure.

**4. Foreign Affairs:**

* **Renegotiating Ukraine Conflict:** Agenda 47 proposes negotiating an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 24 hours, without specifying how this would be achieved.
* **Preventing World War III:** The agenda calls for "cleaning house" of "warmongers and America-Last globalists" in the "Deep State," Pentagon, and State Department. This rhetoric suggests a distrust of the foreign policy establishment and a preference for a more unilateral and less diplomatic approach.
* **Rebuilding Military Strength:** The agenda proposes increasing military spending, asking Europe to reimburse the U.S. for aid to Ukraine, and addressing the "military recruitment crisis" by restoring "the proud culture and honor traditions of America's armed forces." This suggests a more militaristic approach to foreign policy.

**5. Law Enforcement:**

* **Tough-on-Crime Policies:** Agenda 47 advocates for increasing police funding, expanding their liability protections, enforcing stop-and-frisk, and imposing the death penalty for drug dealers and human traffickers. These proposals raise concerns about mass incarceration, racial profiling, and a more punitive criminal justice system.
* **Targeting "Radical Left" Prosecutors:** The agenda calls for investigating and potentially suing "radical left" prosecutors in cities like Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, accusing them of engaging in "race-based enforcement of the law." This suggests a willingness to use the DOJ to target political opponents.
* **National Guard Deployment:** The agenda proposes sending the National Guard to cities with high crime rates, potentially escalating tensions and undermining local control over law enforcement.

**6. Social Issues:**

* **Restricting Transgender Rights:** Agenda 47 proposes banning "gender affirming care," investigating pharmaceutical companies and hospitals that provide such care, and passing a law that recognizes only two genders assigned at birth. These proposals are discriminatory and could harm transgender individuals.
* **Addressing Homelessness:** The agenda calls for using resources diverted from Ukraine aid to "get the homeless off our streets," banning urban camping, and creating "tent cities" where homeless individuals would be relocated and potentially involuntarily committed to mental institutions. These proposals raise concerns about criminalizing homelessness and violating the rights of homeless individuals.
* **Combating Drug Addiction:** The agenda proposes a "full naval embargo" on drug cartels, deploying military assets to target them, and imposing the death penalty for drug smugglers. This suggests a more militaristic approach to drug policy.

**Conclusion:**

Agenda 47 represents a vision for a significantly different America, one with a more powerful executive branch, a more conservative social agenda, a more confrontational foreign policy, and a more punitive approach to law enforcement and social issues. The agenda's proposals raise serious concerns about the potential for abuses of power, discrimination, and a rollback of civil liberties and social progress. Democrats are likely to view Agenda 47 as a dangerous and alarming roadmap for a future conservative administration.
