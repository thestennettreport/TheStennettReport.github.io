## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 27 Breakdown

**Chapter 27: Financial Regulatory Agencies**

**Author:** David R. Burton, Senior Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on financial regulatory agencies, specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and self-regulatory organizations (SROs) like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Burton argues that the Biden Administration is using these agencies to advance a radical agenda that harms investors and stifles capital formation. He outlines a conservative vision for financial regulation that prioritizes free markets, deregulation, and a reduced role for government.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Deregulation and Reduced Government Role:** Burton advocates for a significant reduction in the role of government in financial markets, arguing that excessive regulation stifles innovation and economic growth. He calls for streamlining regulations, reducing compliance costs, and eliminating unnecessary agencies and programs. (Page 862)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a weakening of consumer protections, increased risk for investors, and a more volatile and less stable financial system.
    * **Quote:** "The SEC should be reducing impediments to capital formation, not radically increasing them."
* **Criticism of "Climate Change" Agenda:** Burton criticizes the SEC's efforts to require companies to disclose climate-related risks, arguing that this is an overreach of the agency's authority and imposes unnecessary costs on businesses. (Page 862)
    * **Concern:** This suggests a disregard for the risks posed by climate change to the financial system and could undermine efforts to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable practices.
* **Reforming Securities Laws:** Burton calls for a fundamental reform of securities laws, arguing that they are too complex and burdensome. He advocates for a simplified disclosure system, reduced reporting requirements, and greater flexibility for private offerings. (Page 863)
    * **Concern:** This could weaken investor protections and make it easier for companies to engage in fraud and other misconduct.
* **Abolishing SROs:** Burton recommends abolishing or significantly reforming SROs like FINRA, arguing that they are ineffective, costly, and lack transparency and accountability. (Page 863)
    * **Concern:** This could weaken oversight of the financial industry and could make it more difficult to detect and prevent fraud and other misconduct.
* **Opposition to "Social Justice" and ESG:** Burton explicitly opposes efforts to redefine the purpose of business to include social justice, corporate social responsibility (CSR), stakeholder theory, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, and other similar concepts. (Page 866)
    * **Concern:** This suggests a disregard for the importance of corporate social responsibility and could discourage businesses from adopting sustainable and ethical practices.

**Specific Agency Recommendations & Concerns:**

* **SEC:** Burton calls for the SEC to simplify regulations, reduce reporting requirements, eliminate administrative proceedings, and limit its enforcement powers. He also recommends merging the functions of PCAOB and FINRA into the SEC. (Page 864)
    * **Concern:** These proposals could weaken investor protections, reduce transparency and accountability in the financial industry, and make it more difficult for the SEC to enforce securities laws.
* **CFTC:** Burton recommends modernizing the definition of "commodity" to include digital assets, clarifying the registration requirements for foreign swap trading platforms, and giving the CFTC Chairman greater authority to remove the agency's Executive Director. (Page 866)
    * **Concern:** These proposals could create regulatory uncertainty for the digital asset industry and could weaken oversight of the derivatives market.

**Summary:**

Chapter 27 outlines a conservative vision for financial regulation that prioritizes deregulation, a reduced role for government, and a rejection of efforts to promote corporate social responsibility and address climate change. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a weaker and less effective regulatory system, potentially increasing risks for investors and making the financial system more vulnerable to crises. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a return to the kind of lax regulation that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Weakening of Financial Regulations:** The proposals to deregulate financial markets, reduce the role of government, and abolish or weaken SROs could lead to a less stable and more risky financial system, potentially harming investors and the economy.
* **Increased Risk of Fraud and Misconduct:** The proposals to simplify securities laws and limit the SEC's enforcement powers could make it easier for companies to engage in fraud and other misconduct, potentially harming investors.
* **Disregard for Climate Change:** The criticism of the SEC's climate change disclosure rule suggests a disregard for the risks posed by climate change to the financial system and could discourage businesses from taking steps to address those risks.
* **Opposition to Corporate Social Responsibility:** The explicit rejection of ESG and other concepts related to corporate social responsibility suggests a belief that businesses should prioritize profits over all other considerations, potentially leading to harmful social and environmental consequences.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reinforces the pattern of "Project 2025" to promote a conservative agenda that prioritizes free markets, limited government, and individual responsibility over government intervention, social welfare, and environmental protection. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the stability and fairness of the U.S. financial system, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less regulated and less equitable financial system under a future conservative administration.
