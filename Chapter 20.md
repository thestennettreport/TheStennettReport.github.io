## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 20 Breakdown

**Chapter 20: Department of Veterans Affairs**

**Author:** Brooks D. Tucker, Former Acting Chief of Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), arguing that it needs to be more accountable to veterans and less beholden to the bureaucracy. Tucker praises the progress made under the Trump Administration in making the VA more "Veteran-centric" but expresses concern that the Biden Administration is not sustaining that focus. He outlines a plan to improve the VA's delivery of health care and benefits, address the challenges posed by shifting veteran demographics, and strengthen accountability and oversight.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **"Veteran-Centric" Approach:** Tucker emphasizes the need for a "Veteran-centric" approach, arguing that the VA should prioritize the needs of veterans over the interests of the bureaucracy. (Page 674)
    * **Concern:** While this sounds appealing, it could be used to justify cuts to VA programs and services, privatization of VA health care, and a weakening of protections for VA employees.
    * **Quote:** "The VA must continually strive to be recognized as a 'best in class,' 'Veteran-centric' system with an organizational ethos inspired by and accountable to the needs and problems of veterans, not subservient to the parochial preferences of a bureaucracy."
* **Expanding Community Care:** Tucker advocates for expanding access to community care, allowing veterans to receive health care from private providers outside the VA system. (Page 678)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a defunding of VA hospitals and clinics and could make it more difficult for veterans to access specialized care and services that are only available within the VA system.
* **Reforming Disability Benefits:** Tucker calls for reforming the VA's disability benefits system, suggesting that it has become too generous and is susceptible to fraud. (Page 682)
    * **Concern:** This could make it more difficult for veterans to receive the benefits they deserve and could lead to a decrease in support for disabled veterans.
* **Strengthening Accountability and Oversight:** Tucker advocates for greater accountability and oversight of the VA, including conducting an independent audit, strengthening performance metrics, and improving IT systems. (Page 680)
    * **Concern:** While accountability and oversight are important, this could also be used to justify cuts to VA programs and to increase privatization.

**Specific Agency Recommendations & Concerns:**

* **Veterans Health Administration (VHA):** Tucker calls for rescinding VA policies that provide abortion services and gender reassignment surgery, arguing that they are not related to service-connected conditions. He also recommends expanding access to community care, requiring the VHA to report publicly on its performance, and addressing the challenges posed by shifting veteran demographics. (Page 677)
    * **Concern:** These proposals could restrict access to reproductive health care and transgender care for veterans, undermine VA hospitals and clinics, and make it more difficult for veterans to access timely and affordable care.
* **Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA):** Tucker recommends streamlining the disability claims process, increasing automation, reducing improper payments and fraud, and exploring ways to accelerate reviews of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. (Page 681)
    * **Concern:** These proposals could make it more difficult for veterans to receive disability benefits and could lead to a decrease in support for disabled veterans.
* **Human Resources and Administration (HRA):** Tucker calls for transferring career Senior Executive Service (SES) employees out of politically appointed positions, re-evaluating telework policies, expediting the acquisition of a new HRIT system, and improving the VBA's acquisition workforce. (Page 684)
    * **Concern:** These proposals could politicize the VA workforce, reduce flexibility for employees, and lead to a greater reliance on private contractors, potentially increasing costs and decreasing accountability.

**Summary:**

Chapter 20 outlines a conservative vision for the VA that emphasizes efficiency, accountability, and a reduced role for the federal government in providing health care and benefits to veterans. The chapter's recommendations could lead to an expansion of community care, a tightening of eligibility requirements for disability benefits, and a greater reliance on private contractors. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a decrease in the quality of care and services provided to veterans, particularly those who are low-income, disabled, or rely on specialized care that is only available within the VA system.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Privatization of VA Health Care:** The emphasis on expanding community care could lead to a gradual privatization of VA health care, potentially making it more expensive and less accessible for veterans.
* **Reduced Benefits for Disabled Veterans:** The proposals to reform the disability benefits system could make it more difficult for veterans to receive the benefits they deserve and could lead to a decrease in support for disabled veterans.
* **Politicization of the VA:** The proposals to transfer career SES employees out of politically appointed positions and to strengthen political control over the VA could lead to a more politicized and less accountable agency.
* **Weakening of Employee Protections:** The proposals to re-evaluate telework policies and to improve the VBA's acquisition workforce could reduce flexibility for VA employees and lead to a greater reliance on private contractors, potentially undermining worker protections and job security.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, reflects the conservative agenda to shrink the role of the federal government in providing social services and to promote a more market-oriented approach to government programs. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of American veterans, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less generous and less effective VA under a future conservative administration.
