This website is your essential guide to understanding and resisting the most dangerous threat to American democracy: [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) and [Agenda 47](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47).

They envision an America where:

* Millions lose access to healthcare, education, and social security.
* The environment is ravaged by unchecked pollution and climate change.
* Immigrants are demonized and deported en masse.
* LGBTQIA+ rights are erased, and discrimination is enshrined in law.
* The voices of dissent are silenced, and the media is controlled.
