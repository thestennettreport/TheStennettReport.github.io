# The Stennett Report's Breakdown of Project 2025 and Agenda 47

Welcome to my in-depth analysis of Project 2025 and Agenda 47, two conservative agendas that pose a significant threat to American democracy. This website provides detailed breakdowns of each chapter of Project 2025's "Mandate for Leadership," as well as a comprehensive analysis of Trump's Agenda 47. At the bottom of the page you will find links to the PDFs used to develop this breakdown.

## Project 2025: A Conservative Blueprint for Power

Project 2025 is a massive policy initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, in collaboration with over 50 other conservative organizations. It aims to prepare a "comprehensive blueprint" for a future conservative president to "deconstruct the administrative state" and implement a sweeping conservative agenda across all areas of government.

## Agenda 47: Trump's Vision for a Second Term

Agenda 47 is Donald Trump's policy platform for his 2024 presidential campaign, outlining his plans for a second term. It reflects a focus on expanding presidential power, enacting conservative social policies, and taking a hardline stance on immigration and national security.

## A Dangerous Convergence: Agenda 47 and Project 2025

The overlap between Project 2025 and Agenda 47 is striking, suggesting a coordinated effort to implement a radical conservative agenda should Donald Trump return to the White House in 2025. They share common themes, policy recommendations, and personnel, raising serious concerns about the future of American democracy.

## Unmasking the Trump Connection: Authors and Contributors

Every single author of Project 2025 has direct or indirect ties to the Trump administration, campaign, or family. This raises concerns about the project's objectivity and suggests that it may be more of a political document than a policy document.

## The People's Guide: A Counter-Narrative

"The People's Guide to Project 2025," published by Democracy Forward, provides a valuable counter-narrative, highlighting the potential harms of the project's proposals from a progressive perspective.
