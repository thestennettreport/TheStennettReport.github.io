## Trade War 2.0: Project 2025's Recipe for Economic Disaster

**Introduction:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 promise to "Make America Great Again" through aggressive trade policies, but their vision is a mirage. Their protectionist agenda, including a 10% universal tariff and a decoupling from China, is a recipe for economic disaster, raising prices, killing jobs, and undermining American competitiveness. This page exposes the flawed logic of their trade war and its devastating consequences.

**The False Promise of Protectionism:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 peddle the false promise of protectionism, claiming that tariffs and trade barriers will protect American jobs and boost the economy. This is a dangerous myth, debunked by decades of economic evidence.

**Key Points:**

* **10% Universal Tariff: A Tax on Americans:** The proposed 10% universal tariff is nothing more than a tax on American consumers. It would raise prices on everything from groceries and clothing to cars and electronics, hurting working families and reducing their purchasing power. (See Agenda 47, Economy section)
* **Decoupling from China: A Costly Delusion:**  Decoupling from China, as advocated by Navarro in Project 2025, would disrupt global supply chains, raise costs for businesses, and harm American consumers. It's a costly delusion that ignores the deep integration of the U.S. and Chinese economies. (Chapter 26)
* **Retaliatory Tariffs: A Lose-Lose Scenario:**  Imposing tariffs on other countries inevitably invites retaliatory tariffs, harming American exporters and leading to a downward spiral of trade restrictions. The Trump administration's trade war with China already cost American farmers and businesses billions of dollars. (Chapter 26)
* **Job Losses, Not Gains:**  Protectionist policies often lead to job losses, not gains. When prices rise due to tariffs, consumers buy less, leading to decreased demand and layoffs. The steel tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, for example, resulted in net job losses. (Chapter 26)
* **Stifling Innovation:**  Trade barriers stifle innovation and make American businesses less competitive. By limiting access to global markets and technologies, protectionism discourages investment and slows economic growth.

**Real-World Consequences:**

* **Higher Prices for Consumers:**  Americans would pay more for everyday goods and services, reducing their standard of living and making it harder to make ends meet.
* **Job Losses and Economic Decline:**  Businesses would face higher costs, reduced demand, and uncertainty, leading to job losses and a slowdown in economic growth.
* **Weakened Global Leadership:**  America's retreat from free trade would undermine its global leadership and credibility, ceding economic power to China and other countries.
* **Harm to Small Businesses:**  Small businesses, which often rely on global supply chains and access to foreign markets, would be disproportionately harmed by tariffs and trade barriers.

**Call to Action:**

* **Reject Protectionism:**  Urge elected officials to oppose tariffs and other protectionist policies and to support free trade agreements that benefit American workers and businesses.
* **Support Organizations Promoting Free Trade:**  Donate to and volunteer with organizations like the Cato Institute and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which advocate for free trade and open markets.
* **Educate Yourself and Others:**  Learn about the benefits of free trade and the harms of protectionism, and share this information with your community.
* **Vote in the 2024 Election:**  Make your voice heard and elect leaders who will promote a pro-growth, pro-trade agenda.
