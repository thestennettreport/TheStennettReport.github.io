## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 30 Breakdown

**Chapter 30: Federal Trade Commission**

**Author:** Adam Candeub, Professor of Law at Michigan State University and Former Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), arguing that antitrust law should be used not only to promote economic competition but also to protect democratic values and institutions. Candeub criticizes the FTC under the Biden Administration for being too focused on a narrow "consumer welfare" standard and for allowing corporations to use ESG (environmental, social, and governance) initiatives as a cover for anticompetitive behavior. He outlines a conservative vision for the FTC that emphasizes a broader view of antitrust, a crackdown on Big Tech, and greater cooperation with state attorneys general.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Broader View of Antitrust:** Candeub argues for a broader view of antitrust law, going beyond the traditional focus on consumer welfare to encompass the protection of democratic values such as free speech, the marketplace of ideas, and shareholder control. (Page 902)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a more subjective and less predictable application of antitrust law, potentially chilling innovation and discouraging investment. Democrats may worry that this broader view could be used to target companies based on their political views or social stances.
    * **Quote:** "Antitrust law can combat dominant firmsâ€™ baleful effects on democratic institutions such as free speech, the marketplace of ideas, shareholder control, and managerial accountability as well as collusive behavior with government."
* **Crackdown on Big Tech:** Candeub highlights the power of Big Tech companies and their potential to harm competition and democratic institutions. He advocates for the FTC to take a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement against these companies, including investigating their use of ESG initiatives as a cover for anticompetitive behavior. (Page 910)
    * **Concern:** While Democrats generally share concerns about Big Tech's power, they may be wary of using antitrust law to address issues like content moderation and online speech, which they may view as primarily First Amendment concerns.
* **Cooperation with State AGs:** Candeub recommends that the FTC increase its cooperation with state attorneys general, arguing that they are more responsive to their constituents and can provide valuable insights into local market conditions. (Page 912)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a more fragmented and less consistent approach to antitrust enforcement, as state AGs may have different priorities and enforcement philosophies. Democrats may also be concerned that this could empower Republican AGs to pursue politically motivated investigations against companies that they disagree with.
* **Protecting Children Online:** Candeub argues that the FTC should investigate online platforms' practices that target children, such as advertising and data collection, as potential unfair trade practices. (Page 908)
    * **Concern:** While protecting children online is a bipartisan priority, Democrats may be concerned about the potential for government overreach and censorship in this area. They may also be wary of imposing new regulations on online platforms that could stifle innovation and free speech.

**Summary:**

Chapter 30 outlines a conservative vision for the FTC that emphasizes a broader view of antitrust law, a crackdown on Big Tech, and greater cooperation with state attorneys general. While some of these proposals, such as protecting children online, may find bipartisan support, others, such as the broader view of antitrust and the focus on ESG, are likely to be more controversial and could raise concerns among Democrats about the potential for government overreach, censorship, and a politicization of antitrust enforcement.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Expansion of Antitrust Law:** The broader view of antitrust advocated by Candeub could be used to target companies based on their political views or social stances, potentially chilling free speech and discouraging investment.
* **Weakening of Consumer Welfare Standard:** The emphasis on factors beyond consumer welfare could lead to a less rigorous and more subjective application of antitrust law, potentially harming consumers and stifling innovation.
* **Politicization of Antitrust Enforcement:** The call for greater cooperation with state AGs could empower Republican AGs to pursue politically motivated investigations against companies that they disagree with.
* **Government Overreach in Online Regulation:** The proposal to investigate online platforms' practices that target children could lead to excessive government regulation of the internet and could undermine free speech online.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, highlights the conservative agenda to reorient federal agencies towards a more ideological and less technocratic approach. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the FTC's enforcement priorities, the balance of power between the federal government and states, and the relationship between government and the private sector. Democrats are likely to be concerned about the potential for a more politicized and less predictable FTC under a future conservative administration, with a weaker commitment to protecting consumers and promoting competition.
