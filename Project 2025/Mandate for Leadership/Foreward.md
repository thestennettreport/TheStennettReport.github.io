## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Foreword Breakdown

**Introduction:**

This foreword, written by Kevin D. Roberts, PhD, President of The Heritage Foundation, sets the stage for "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership." It draws parallels between the current political climate and that of the late 1970s, highlighting the need for a bold conservative agenda to address the nation's challenges. The foreword outlines four key promises that form the core of this agenda.

**Key Points:**

- **America in Crisis:** The foreword opens by comparing the current state of America to the late 1970s, a time of economic and social turmoil. It argues that the nation is once again facing significant challenges, including a discredited political class, a raging culture war, and the rise of China as a global threat. (Page 34)
    - **Quote:** "Today, America and the conservative movement are enduring an era of division and danger akin to the late 1970s."
- **The Conservative Promise:** The foreword outlines four key promises that form the core of the conservative agenda:
    - **Promise #1: Restore the Family:**  This promise emphasizes the importance of strengthening the American family and protecting children. It calls for policies that promote marriage, parental rights, and a culture of life. It also advocates for confronting threats to family stability, such as those posed by Big Tech and pornography. (Page 37)
        - **Quote:** "The next conservative President must get to work pursuing the true priority of politicsâ€”the well-being of the American family."
    - **Promise #2: Dismantle the Administrative State:** This promise focuses on reducing the size and scope of the federal government and returning power to the American people. It calls for restoring constitutional accountability, reining in the bureaucracy, and ending the "Administrative State." (Page 40)
        - **Quote:** "The surest way to put the federal government back to work for the American people is to reduce its size and scope back to something resembling the original constitutional intent."
    - **Promise #3: Defend National Sovereignty:** This promise emphasizes the need to protect America's sovereignty, borders, and resources from global threats. It calls for ending illegal immigration, securing the border, decoupling from China, and achieving energy dominance. (Page 43)
        - **Quote:** "The United States belongs to 'We the people.' All government authority derives from the consent of the people, and our nation's success derives from the character of its people."
    - **Promise #4: Secure Individual Liberty:** This promise focuses on protecting individual rights and freedoms, including economic freedom, religious freedom, and freedom of speech. It calls for promoting free enterprise, limiting government intervention, and defending the Constitution. (Page 47)
        - **Quote:** "The American Republic was founded on principles prioritizing and maximizing individuals' rights to live their best life or to enjoy what the Framers called 'the Blessings of Liberty.'"
- **Mandate for Leadership:** The foreword highlights the legacy of the original "Mandate for Leadership" published in 1981, which provided a blueprint for the Reagan Revolution. It argues that this new "Mandate for Leadership" will similarly equip the next conservative President with a bold and courageous plan to restore America's greatness. (Page 35)
    - **Quote:** "This book is the product of more than 400 scholars and policy experts from across the conservative movement and around the country. This is an agenda prepared by and for conservatives who will be ready on Day One of the next Administration to save our country from the brink of disaster."

**Summary:**

The foreword serves as a call to action for conservatives to unite behind a bold agenda that prioritizes the family, individual liberty, national sovereignty, and constitutional governance. It argues that "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" provides the blueprint for this agenda and will equip the next conservative President with the tools and policies necessary to restore America's greatness.
