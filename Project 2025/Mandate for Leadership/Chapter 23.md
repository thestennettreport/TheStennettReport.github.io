## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 23 Breakdown

**Chapter 23: Export-Import Bank**

**Authors:** Jennifer Hazelton (The Case for the Export-Import Bank) and Veronique de Rugy (The Export-Import Bank Should Be Abolished)

**Introduction:**

This chapter presents two opposing viewpoints on the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), a federal agency that provides financing to support U.S. exports. Jennifer Hazelton argues for maintaining and strengthening EXIM, claiming it is a vital tool for promoting American businesses and countering China's economic aggression. Veronique de Rugy argues for abolishing EXIM, claiming it is a form of corporate welfare that distorts markets, harms small businesses, and wastes taxpayer money.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats (Hazelton's Argument):**

* **Countering China:** Hazelton argues that EXIM is a "strategic weapon" in the fight against China's economic aggression, particularly in the area of export credit financing. She claims that China's aggressive use of export subsidies is giving its companies an unfair advantage in global markets and that the U.S. needs EXIM to level the playing field. (Page 724)
    * **Concern:** While countering China's economic influence is a legitimate concern, using EXIM as a primary tool could lead to a costly and ineffective subsidy race that ultimately harms American taxpayers and businesses.
    * **Quote:** "Export credit is a strategy weapon in Chinaâ€™s whole-of-government approach to enhance its global power."
* **Supporting American Jobs and Businesses:** Hazelton argues that EXIM supports American jobs and businesses by financing exports that would not otherwise occur. She claims that EXIM helps both large and small businesses and that it has a strong track record of success. (Page 724)
    * **Concern:** Evidence suggests that EXIM primarily benefits a small number of large corporations, like Boeing, and that its impact on small businesses is limited. Additionally, many of the exports that EXIM finances would likely occur even without government support.
* **Protecting Taxpayers:** Hazelton argues that EXIM is a good deal for taxpayers because it operates at a profit, returning more money to the Treasury than it receives in appropriations. (Page 759)
    * **Concern:** This accounting relies on questionable assumptions about risk and ignores the potential for future defaults, which could leave taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in losses.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats (De Rugy's Argument):**

* **Corporate Welfare:** De Rugy argues that EXIM is a form of corporate welfare that benefits a small number of large corporations at the expense of taxpayers and small businesses. She claims that EXIM distorts markets by providing subsidies to companies that could obtain financing from private lenders. (Page 717)
    * **Concern:** This argument aligns with Democratic concerns about corporate welfare and the need to ensure that government programs benefit ordinary Americans, not just wealthy special interests.
    * **Quote:** "EXIM operates in effect as a protectionist agency that picks winners and losers in the market by providing political privileges to firms that are already well-financed."
* **Harming Small Businesses:** De Rugy argues that EXIM actually harms small businesses by subsidizing their larger competitors, making it more difficult for them to compete. (Page 717)
    * **Concern:** This aligns with Democratic concerns about the need to support small businesses and to ensure that government policies do not create an unfair advantage for large corporations.
* **Wasting Taxpayer Money:** De Rugy argues that EXIM wastes taxpayer money by financing exports that would have occurred anyway and by taking on unnecessary risks that could lead to future defaults. (Page 753)
    * **Concern:** This aligns with Democratic concerns about fiscal responsibility and the need to ensure that government programs are effective and efficient.

**Summary:**

Chapter 23 presents two contrasting views on EXIM, highlighting the ongoing debate about the role of government in supporting U.S. exports. Hazelton's argument for maintaining and strengthening EXIM reflects a more interventionist approach, while de Rugy's argument for abolishing EXIM reflects a more market-oriented approach. Democrats are likely to be more sympathetic to de Rugy's concerns about corporate welfare, the negative impact on small businesses, and the potential for wasting taxpayer money.

**Why This Chapter Might Be of Interest to Democrats:**

* **Debate on Corporate Welfare:** The chapter provides a useful overview of the arguments for and against EXIM, highlighting the ongoing debate about the role of government in supporting U.S. exports and the potential for corporate welfare.
* **Impact on Small Businesses:** The chapter raises concerns about the negative impact of EXIM on small businesses, which aligns with Democratic priorities of supporting small businesses and promoting economic fairness.
* **Fiscal Responsibility:** The chapter highlights the potential for EXIM to waste taxpayer money, which aligns with Democratic concerns about fiscal responsibility and the need for effective and efficient government programs.
* **China's Economic Influence:** The chapter acknowledges the challenge posed by China's economic aggression, but it also raises questions about the effectiveness of using EXIM as a primary tool for countering that influence.

This chapter, unlike some of the previous chapters, does not present a clear consensus within the conservative movement. The opposing viewpoints on EXIM reflect the broader debate within the Republican Party about the role of government in the economy and the appropriate balance between free markets and government intervention. Democrats are likely to find de Rugy's arguments more persuasive and may see this chapter as an opportunity to build bipartisan support for reforming or eliminating EXIM.
