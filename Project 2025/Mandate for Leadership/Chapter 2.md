## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 2 Breakdown

**Chapter 2: Executive Office of the President of the United States**

**Author:** Russ Vought, Former Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the collection of agencies and offices that directly support the President. Vought argues that the EOP must be used aggressively to "limit, control, and direct the executive branch" and to dismantle the "Administrative State." He outlines specific recommendations for how a conservative President can utilize key EOP components to achieve these goals.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Office of Management and Budget (OMB):** Vought sees OMB as the President's primary tool for controlling the bureaucracy. He advocates for aggressive use of OMB's budgetary and regulatory powers to advance the President's agenda and "bring the bureaucracy in line." (Page 77)
    * **Concern:** This suggests a willingness to disregard agency expertise and potentially circumvent Congressional intent to impose the President's will on the executive branch.
    * **Quote:** "Properly understood, it is a Presidentâ€™s air-traffic control system with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course."
* **Apportionments:** Vought recommends that Program Associate Directors (PADs) personally sign apportionments, giving them greater control over agency spending. (Page 78)
    * **Concern:** This could be used to starve agencies of funding for programs that are not aligned with the President's priorities, even if those programs have been authorized by Congress.
* **Regulatory Reform:** Vought calls for a rollback of regulations, including reviving Trump-era executive orders that streamlined the regulatory process and limited agency discretion. He also advocates for extending regulatory review to independent agencies. (Page 82)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a weakening of environmental, consumer, and worker protections and undermine the independence of agencies like the EPA and SEC.
* **National Security Council (NSC):** Vought recommends a strong NSC that can "drive the bureaucracy" and eliminate directorates not aligned with the President's agenda. (Page 84)
    * **Concern:** This suggests a militarization of policymaking and a potential for prioritizing national security over other important considerations.
* **"Woke" Culture:** Vought repeatedly criticizes the "woke" culture within the federal government and calls for eliminating programs and initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, climate change, and gender identity. (Page 93)
    * **Concern:** This suggests a disregard for the importance of diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce and a dismissal of the scientific consensus on climate change.

**Summary:**

Chapter 2 outlines a plan to significantly restructure the federal government, giving the President greater control over the bureaucracy and weakening the influence of career civil servants. These proposals could have a chilling effect on the ability of the federal government to function effectively and impartially, raising serious concerns among Democrats about potential abuses of power and a disregard for the expertise and experience of career civil servants.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Erosion of Democratic Norms:** The proposals in this chapter represent a significant departure from traditional norms of governance and civil service neutrality. They suggest a willingness to use the power of the executive branch to advance a partisan agenda and silence dissenting voices.
* **Undermining Expertise:** The emphasis on political loyalty over expertise could lead to a decline in the quality of government services and a weakening of the federal government's ability to address complex policy challenges.
* **Increased Inequality:** Weakening worker protections could lead to lower wages and benefits for federal employees, exacerbating existing inequalities.
* **Chilling Effect on Dissent:** The proposals to weaken civil service protections could create a climate of fear within the federal workforce, discouraging employees from speaking out against wrongdoing or offering alternative viewpoints.

This chapter offers a glimpse into the potential for a radical reshaping of the federal government under a future conservative administration. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americans, raising serious concerns about the future of our democracy and the ability of the federal government to serve the public good.
