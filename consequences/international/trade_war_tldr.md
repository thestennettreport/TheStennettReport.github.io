title: Trade War 2.0 - A Recipe for Economic Disaster and Higher Prices for All Americans - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's protectionist trade agenda, including a 10% universal tariff, is a recipe for economic disaster, raising prices for consumers, harming businesses, and undermining American competitiveness.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Protectionism as a False Promise:** The agenda peddles the myth that tariffs and trade barriers will protect American jobs and boost the economy, ignoring decades of evidence showing the opposite.
* **"America First" at All Costs:** It embraces economic nationalism, prioritizing domestic industries and workers even if it means harming consumers, disrupting global trade, and undermining international cooperation.
* **Disregard for the Global Economy:** It ignores the interconnectedness of the global economy, failing to recognize that trade wars harm all participants and that raising barriers to trade ultimately hurts American businesses and consumers.
* **Targeting China:** It fixates on China as the primary economic threat, advocating for decoupling and a confrontational approach to trade, ignoring the benefits of trade with China and the potential for mutually beneficial economic cooperation.
* **Appealing to Economic Anxiety:** The agenda exploits economic anxiety and fear of globalization, particularly among those who have been left behind by economic changes, offering false solutions that would ultimately harm those it claims to help.

**Critical Quote:**

"Trade wars are good, and easy to win." <sup>(Donald Trump)</sup>

**Why It Matters:**

This protectionist agenda would have devastating consequences for the U.S. economy, leading to higher prices, job losses, reduced economic growth, and a decline in American competitiveness. It would harm consumers, businesses, and the overall economy.

**Red Flags:**

* **10% Universal Tariff:**  A tax on American consumers that would raise prices on everything, disproportionately harming low- and middle-income families.
* **Decoupling from China:**  Disrupting global supply chains, raising costs for businesses, and harming American consumers.
* **Retaliatory Tariffs:**  Triggering a downward spiral of trade restrictions, harming American exporters and leading to a trade war that hurts everyone.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's trade war is a dangerous gamble with the American economy. It's a recipe for economic disaster, driven by a misguided ideology and a willingness to exploit economic anxiety for political gain. We must reject protectionism and embrace policies that promote free trade, open markets, and international cooperation.
