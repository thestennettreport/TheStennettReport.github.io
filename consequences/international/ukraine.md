title: The Fate of Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ - Abandoned by America ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸?
---

Based on the information we've gathered from Project 2025 and Agenda 47, we can make some strong inferences about the likely fate of aid to Ukraine under a second Trump administration, but some aspects remain unclear.

**Evidence Suggesting a Reduction or Elimination of Aid**

* **"America First" Foreign Policy:** Both Project 2025 and Agenda 47 emphasize an "America First" foreign policy that prioritizes U.S. interests over international commitments or alliances. This suggests a skepticism towards foreign aid in general and a reluctance to engage in costly interventions abroad.
* **Trump's Past Statements and Actions:** Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about U.S. support for Ukraine, both during his presidency and on the campaign trail. He has questioned the value of NATO and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin.
* **Project 2025's Recommendations:** Chapter 4 of "Mandate for Leadership," written by former Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, calls for increasing allied burden-sharing in NATO and suggests that European allies should take more responsibility for countering Russia. This implies a reduced role for the U.S. in European security.
* **Agenda 47's Proposals:** Agenda 47 includes a proposal to "prevent World War III" by cleaning house of "warmongers and America-Last globalists" in the "Deep State," Pentagon, and State Department. This rhetoric suggests a distrust of the foreign policy establishment and a preference for a less interventionist approach.
* **The Lincoln Project Transcript:** The transcript outlining a potential second Trump term explicitly states that Trump would "end Pentagon cooperation with Ukraine," leading to a Russian victory and the death of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Uncertainties:**

* **Congressional Support:** The level of congressional support for continued aid to Ukraine is unclear. While some Republicans have expressed support for Ukraine, others have been more skeptical. A Republican-controlled Congress could make it more difficult for a second Trump administration to provide aid.
* **Public Opinion:** Public opinion on aid to Ukraine has shifted somewhat in recent months, with some Americans expressing concerns about the cost and duration of the conflict. A decline in public support could make it easier for Trump to reduce or eliminate aid.
* **Trump's Unpredictability:** Trump is known for his unpredictable and often contradictory statements and actions. It is possible that he could change his position on aid to Ukraine depending on political circumstances or personal whims.

**Potential Scenarios:**

Based on the available evidence, several scenarios are possible:

1. **Significant Reduction or Elimination of Aid:** Trump could use his executive authority to significantly reduce or eliminate military and financial aid to Ukraine, arguing that it is not in America's national interest and that European allies should bear more of the burden.
2. **Conditional Aid:** Trump could offer conditional aid to Ukraine, demanding concessions from the Ukrainian government or linking aid to a negotiated settlement with Russia that is favorable to Russian interests.
3. **Continuation of Aid at Reduced Levels:**  Trump could face pressure from Congress and international allies to continue providing aid to Ukraine, but he could reduce the level of support and shift the focus away from military assistance.

**Implications for Ukraine:**

A reduction or elimination of U.S. aid would have a significant impact on Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia. It could lead to a Russian victory, a loss of Ukrainian territory, and a humanitarian crisis. It would also send a signal to other U.S. allies that America is an unreliable partner and could embolden authoritarian regimes around the world.

**Conclusion:**

While there are some uncertainties, the evidence strongly suggests that a second Trump administration would likely reduce or eliminate aid to Ukraine. This would be a major foreign policy shift with significant implications for Ukraine, U.S. global leadership, and the future of democracy. Democrats and others who support Ukraine should be prepared to challenge any efforts to reduce or eliminate aid and to advocate for continued U.S. support for Ukraine's fight for freedom and democracy.
