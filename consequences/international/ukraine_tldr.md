title: Abandoning Ukraine - A Blueprint for Retreat, Appeasement, and a Russian Victory - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47, combined with Trump's history of appeasement towards Putin, suggest a chilling future for Ukraine: a likely abandonment of U.S. support, a weakening of NATO, and a Russian victory.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **"America First" Isolationism:** The agenda prioritizes narrow U.S. interests over international commitments and alliances, suggesting a reluctance to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
* **Admiration for Authoritarian Leaders:**  Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, questioning the value of supporting democracies and suggesting a preference for strongmen.
* **Skepticism Towards NATO:**  Project 2025 and Agenda 47 express skepticism towards NATO, arguing that European allies should bear more of the burden for their own defense and that the U.S. should reduce its commitments.
* **Focus on Domestic Issues:**  The project prioritizes domestic issues over foreign policy, suggesting a willingness to disengage from international conflicts, even those vital to global security and democracy.
* **Transactional Foreign Policy:**  Trump's foreign policy is often transactional, focused on short-term gains and personal relationships rather than on long-term strategic interests or values-based alliances.

**Why It Matters:**

A reduction or elimination of U.S. support for Ukraine would have devastating consequences, not only for Ukraine but also for the future of democracy, the stability of Europe, and America's global leadership.

**Red Flags:**

* **Reducing or Eliminating Aid to Ukraine:**  Project 2025 and Agenda 47 suggest a likely reduction or elimination of military and financial assistance to Ukraine, crippling its ability to defend itself.
* **Pressuring Ukraine to Negotiate with Russia:**  Trump could pressure Ukraine to make concessions to Russia, even if it means accepting a loss of territory and sovereignty.
* **Weakening or Withdrawing from NATO:**  Trump's skepticism towards NATO could lead to a weakening of the alliance or even a U.S. withdrawal, emboldening Russia and undermining European security.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47, combined with Trump's history of appeasement towards Putin, paint a bleak picture for the future of Ukraine. It's a blueprint for retreat, appeasement, and a betrayal of a democratic ally fighting for its survival. We must elect leaders who are committed to supporting Ukraine, strengthening NATO, and standing up to authoritarian aggression.
