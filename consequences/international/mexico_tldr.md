title: Poisoning the Partnership - The Devastating Impact on U.S.-Mexico Relations - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's aggressive and hostile approach to immigration, combined with their disregard for Mexican sovereignty, threatens to poison the U.S.-Mexico relationship, with devastating consequences for both nations.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Xenophobia and Scapegoating:** The agenda demonizes Mexico and Mexican immigrants, portraying them as criminals and threats to American security, fueling xenophobia and undermining the foundation of a healthy relationship.
* **Border Militarization:** The obsession with border security, including the construction of a wall and the deployment of more agents and technology, creates a militarized zone that symbolizes hostility and distrust.
* **Disregard for Mexican Sovereignty:**  Project 2025 and Agenda 47 advocate for policies that disregard Mexican sovereignty, seeking to impose U.S. will on Mexico through pressure, coercion, and even potential intervention.
* **Economic Warfare:**  The project's protectionist trade policies, particularly those targeting China, could indirectly harm Mexico's economy, which is deeply integrated into North American supply chains.
* **Undermining Cooperation:** The aggressive approach to immigration and disregard for Mexican interests would undermine cooperation on shared challenges like drug trafficking, organized crime, climate change, and economic development.

**Critical Quote:**

**Why It Matters:**

A healthy U.S.-Mexico relationship is essential for the prosperity and security of both nations. Project 2025's agenda threatens to turn a vital partnership into a toxic rivalry, with far-reaching consequences for regional stability, economic growth, and the well-being of communities on both sides of the border.

**Red Flags:**

* **Mass Deportations:**  Sending millions of undocumented immigrants back to Mexico, overwhelming its resources and fueling anti-American sentiment.
* **Ending Birthright Citizenship:**  Stripping U.S.-born children of Mexican parents of their citizenship, creating a legal and humanitarian crisis.
* **"Remain in Mexico" Policy:**  Forcing asylum seekers to wait in dangerous conditions in Mexico while their cases are processed in the U.S.
* **Economic Pressure and Potential Intervention:**  Using tariffs, sanctions, and even threats of military intervention to coerce Mexico into complying with U.S. demands.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's approach to Mexico is dangerous and destructive. It would poison the relationship, undermine cooperation, and harm both countries. We must advocate for a more respectful, collaborative, and mutually beneficial partnership that addresses shared challenges and recognizes the interconnectedness of our two nations.
