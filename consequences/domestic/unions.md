title: Unions Under Attack - Project 2025's Assault on Worker Power
---

**Introduction:**

Project 2025 doesn't just target individual programs; it aims to dismantle the very foundations of worker power by weakening unions and undermining collective bargaining. This page exposes their agenda, which would leave millions of American workers vulnerable to exploitation, lower wages, and diminished benefits.

**Key Points:**

* **"Right to Work" Expansion:** Project 2025 advocates for expanding "right to work" laws, which weaken unions by allowing workers to opt out of paying union dues, even if they benefit from union-negotiated contracts. This would starve unions of resources and make it harder for them to organize and represent workers. (Chapter 18)
* **Restricting Public Sector Unions:** The project specifically targets public sector unions, arguing that they are incompatible with good government management. They propose limiting their bargaining power, increasing their financial transparency, and potentially eliminating them altogether. (Chapter 3)
* **Weakening the NLRB:** Project 2025 seeks to weaken the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the agency responsible for enforcing labor laws and protecting workers' right to organize. They propose limiting the NLRB's authority, reducing its budget, and appointing anti-union members to the board. (Chapter 18)
* **Undermining "Protected Concerted Activity":** The project aims to narrow the definition of "protected concerted activity," which protects workers from retaliation for engaging in union organizing or other collective action. This would make it easier for employers to punish workers who try to form a union. (Chapter 18)
* **Promoting "Employee Involvement Organizations":** Project 2025 advocates for the creation of non-union "employee involvement organizations" (EIOs), which they claim would give workers a voice without the need for unions. However, these EIOs would likely be dominated by management and would lack the power and independence of unions. (Chapter 18)

**Real-World Consequences:**

* **Lower Wages and Benefits:** Weakening unions would lead to lower wages and benefits for millions of American workers, as employers would have more power to dictate terms of employment.
* **Worse Working Conditions:** Without strong unions to advocate for their rights, workers would be more vulnerable to unsafe working conditions, unfair scheduling practices, and other forms of exploitation.
* **Increased Inequality:** The decline of unions would exacerbate income inequality, as the gap between the wealthy and working class widens.
* **Weakened Worker Voice:**  Workers would have less power to negotiate for better wages, benefits, and working conditions, leading to a decline in worker morale and productivity.

**Call to Action:**

* **Stand Up for Unions:**  Support efforts to strengthen unions and protect workers' right to organize.
* **Contact Your Elected Officials:**  Demand that they oppose "right to work" laws, protect public sector unions, and strengthen the NLRB.
* **Educate Yourself and Others:**  Learn about the importance of unions and the benefits of collective bargaining, and share this information with your community.
* **Support Pro-Worker Organizations:**  Donate to and volunteer with organizations like the AFL-CIO, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the Economic Policy Institute, which are fighting for worker rights.
