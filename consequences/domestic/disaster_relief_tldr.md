title: Disaster Capitalism - Profiting from Calamity and Leaving Communities to Fend for Themselves - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 exploit disasters to advance a radical agenda of privatization, shrinking FEMA, and shifting the burden of recovery onto individuals, leaving vulnerable communities to fend for themselves while corporations profit from their suffering.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Shrinking FEMA and Federal Aid:**  The agenda aims to cripple FEMA by reducing its budget, staffing, and authority, limiting its ability to respond effectively to disasters and provide aid to those in need.
* **Privatization of Disaster Relief:**  Project 2025 promotes handing over disaster relief efforts to private companies, opening the door to profiteering, higher costs, and unequal access to assistance.
* **Individual Responsibility Over Collective Support:**  The project emphasizes individual responsibility for disaster preparedness and recovery, even blaming victims for their suffering, while ignoring systemic inequalities that make some communities more vulnerable.
* **Climate Change Denial:**  The project's rejection of climate science and opposition to environmental regulations will exacerbate the frequency and severity of disasters, creating a vicious cycle of increased need and reduced support.
* **"Disaster Capitalism":**  This agenda creates a breeding ground for "disaster capitalism," where corporations and wealthy individuals profit from tragedy while vulnerable communities are left behind.

**Critical Quote:**

"The federal government should not be in the business of bailing out people who choose to live in disaster-prone areas." <sup>([Chapter 5](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_5.md))</sup>

**Why It Matters:**

This agenda would leave communities devastated by disasters with less support, higher costs, and fewer resources to rebuild their lives. It would turn tragedy into an opportunity for profiteering and exacerbate existing inequalities.

**Red Flags:**

* **Gutting FEMA:**  Weakening FEMA's capacity to respond to disasters would leave communities more vulnerable and increase the human cost of natural disasters.
* **Privatizing Essential Services:**  Handing over essential services like debris removal, housing construction, and healthcare to private companies would lead to higher costs and reduced accountability.
* **Blaming the Victims:**  The emphasis on individual responsibility ignores systemic factors that contribute to vulnerability and blames those who are already suffering.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's approach to disaster relief is cruel, short-sighted, and dangerous. It would exploit tragedy for profit and abandon those most in need. We must fight back against this agenda and demand a compassionate, effective, and equitable government response to disasters.
