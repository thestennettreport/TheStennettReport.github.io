title: The Assault on Public Education - Project 2025's Plan to Privatize, Defund, and Indoctrinate
---

**Introduction:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 don't just aim to reform education; they want to dismantle public education as we know it. This page exposes their plan to defund public schools, expand privatization through vouchers and charter schools, censor curricula, and impose a narrow ideological agenda on America's children.

**A Multi-Pronged Attack on Public Education:**

Their strategy is clear: starve public schools of resources, empower private and religious schools, and control what children learn, creating a system that prioritizes ideology over education and exacerbates inequality.

**1. Defunding Public Schools: A Death by a Thousand Cuts**

Project 2025 advocates for a systematic defunding of public schools, making it harder for them to provide quality education to all students:

* **Eliminating the Department of Education:**  They call for eliminating the Department of Education, arguing that it's unnecessary and bureaucratic. This would shift responsibility for education to states, many of which lack the resources or the will to adequately fund public schools. (Chapter 11)
* **Expanding School Choice:**  They aggressively promote school choice, including vouchers and charter schools, which divert public funds away from traditional public schools and create a two-tiered system that benefits wealthier families. (Chapters 11 and 18)
* **Block Granting Federal Funds:**  They advocate for block granting federal education funds to states, giving them more flexibility but also potentially leading to cuts in funding for schools in low-income communities. (Chapter 11)
* **Tax Credits for Private Schools:**  Agenda 47 proposes tax credits for donations to private schools, further incentivizing the shift away from public education. (Agenda 47, Education)

**2. Privatization: Profiting from Education**

Project 2025 sees privatization as the solution to America's education woes, but this approach prioritizes profits over the public good:

* **Vouchers and Charter Schools:**  They view vouchers and charter schools as the ideal model for education, arguing that competition will improve quality. However, this ignores the fact that private and religious schools can discriminate against students and teachers, and that charter schools often lack accountability and transparency.
* **For-Profit Education:**  The project's emphasis on free markets could lead to an expansion of for-profit education companies, which prioritize profits over student outcomes and often target vulnerable populations.
* **Online Education:**  They promote online education as a cost-effective alternative to traditional schools, but this ignores the challenges of ensuring quality and equity in online learning, particularly for low-income students and students with disabilities.

**3. Censorship and Indoctrination: Controlling What Children Learn**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 seek to control what children learn in schools, pushing a narrow ideological agenda and censoring perspectives that challenge their worldview:

* **Banning Critical Race Theory and "Gender Ideology":**  They advocate for banning critical race theory and "gender ideology" from schools, claiming that these concepts are divisive and harmful. This is a thinly veiled attempt to censor discussions about race, gender, and sexuality and to whitewash American history. (Chapters 11 and 25)
* **Promoting "Patriotic" Education:**  They call for a return to "patriotic" education, which often means promoting a sanitized version of American history that ignores the country's flaws and celebrates its triumphs. (Chapter 11)
* **Mandating a Christian Nationalist Curriculum:**  The Lincoln Project transcript suggests that Trump could go even further, mandating a nationwide Christian nationalist curriculum for all schools receiving federal aid. This would impose a narrow religious worldview on public education and violate the separation of church and state.
* **Restricting Access to Information:**  They seek to limit students' access to information that challenges their ideology, including books, websites, and guest speakers. (Agenda 47, Education)

**Real-World Consequences: A Two-Tiered System and a Less Informed Citizenry**

The consequences of Project 2025's assault on public education would be devastating:

* **A Two-Tiered Education System:**  Defunding public schools and expanding privatization would create a two-tiered education system, with wealthy families able to afford better educational options while low-income students are left behind in underfunded and under-resourced schools.
* **Increased Inequality and Segregation:**  School choice policies often exacerbate segregation and inequality, as students are sorted into schools based on race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
* **A Less Informed and Less Engaged Citizenry:**  Censorship and indoctrination in schools would produce a less informed and less engaged citizenry, ill-equipped to participate in a democratic society.
* **Erosion of Critical Thinking:**  Restricting access to diverse perspectives and critical thinking skills would leave students unprepared to navigate a complex and changing world.

**Call to Action:**

We must defend public education and fight back against Project 2025's agenda:

* **Support Public Schools:**  Advocate for increased funding for public schools and oppose efforts to defund or privatize them.
* **Challenge School Choice Schemes:**  Expose the flaws and inequities of voucher and charter school programs and advocate for policies that strengthen public education for all students.
* **Fight Censorship and Indoctrination:**  Defend academic freedom and the right of students to learn about a wide range of perspectives and ideas.
* **Support Teacher Unions:**  Stand with teachers and their unions, who are on the front lines of defending public education.
* **Vote in the 2024 Election:**  Make your voice heard and elect leaders who will prioritize public education and invest in the future of our children.

Public education is the cornerstone of a strong and vibrant democracy. We must not let Project 2025 and Agenda 47 dismantle it.
