title: Broken Promises - How Project 2025 Betrays America's Veterans
---

**Introduction:**

Project 2025, cloaked in patriotic rhetoric about supporting veterans, reveals a chilling truth: its agenda would dismantle the very system designed to care for those who served our country. This page exposes the project's plan to shrink the VA, restrict benefits, and prioritize privatization, leaving millions of veterans vulnerable and betrayed.

**A Smaller, Weaker VA: The Foundation of Betrayal**

At the heart of Project 2025's betrayal lies a fundamental belief: the government should play a smaller role in veterans' lives. This translates into a systematic effort to weaken the VA, making it less effective and less able to serve those who rely on it:

* **Shrinking the Budget:** Project 2025 advocates for reducing the VA's budget, potentially leading to cuts in staffing, services, and infrastructure. This would leave the VA stretched thin, unable to meet the growing needs of a diverse veteran population. (Chapter 20)
* **Undermining VA Hospitals and Clinics:** The push for "community care," while framed as giving veterans more choice, could be a Trojan horse for privatization. By diverting funding to private providers, Project 2025 could undermine VA hospitals and clinics, leading to closures and reduced access to specialized care. (Chapter 20)
* **Gutting the VBA:** The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), responsible for processing disability claims and other benefits, is a prime target for Project 2025's efficiency crusade. Their proposals to increase automation and outsource claims processing could lead to delays, errors, and a less responsive system for veterans seeking the benefits they deserve. (Chapter 20)

**Restricting Disability Benefits: Turning Their Backs on the Wounded**

Project 2025's attack on the VA extends to its core mission: providing disability benefits to veterans who were injured or became ill as a result of their service. Their proposals would make it harder for veterans to receive the support they need:

* **Limiting Qualifying Conditions:** Project 2025 suggests reducing the number of health conditions that qualify for disability benefits, potentially leaving many veterans with service-connected disabilities without the financial and medical support they need. (Chapter 20)
* **Tightening Eligibility Requirements:** The project advocates for stricter eligibility requirements and increased scrutiny of disability claims, potentially creating more bureaucratic hurdles for veterans and delaying access to benefits. (Chapter 20)
* **Accelerating Reviews of the VASRD:**  Project 2025 calls for accelerating reviews of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD), which could lead to lower disability ratings and reduced benefits for veterans. (Chapter 20)

**Privatization: Profiting from Veterans' Needs**

Project 2025's embrace of privatization poses a significant threat to the VA. By shifting services to private providers, they aim to reduce the government's role in veterans' lives, but this could come at a steep cost:

* **Higher Costs and Lower Quality:**  Private healthcare providers often charge higher prices than the VA and may not have the same expertise in treating veterans' unique health needs. This could lead to higher costs and lower quality care for veterans.
* **Reduced Accountability:**  Privatization could reduce accountability and transparency, making it more difficult to ensure that veterans are receiving quality care and that taxpayer dollars are being used effectively.
* **Profiting from Veterans' Suffering:**  Privatization could create a system where private companies profit from veterans' needs, potentially putting profits before people.

**Ignoring the Mental Health Crisis:**

Project 2025 pays lip service to the mental health crisis among veterans, but its proposals do little to address this urgent issue:

* **Inadequate Funding:**  The project's calls for budget cuts and privatization could leave the VA with fewer resources to provide mental health care to veterans.
* **Lack of Focus:**  Project 2025 lacks a comprehensive plan to address the root causes of the mental health crisis, such as PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and military sexual trauma.
* **Stigma and Barriers to Care:**  The project's emphasis on individual responsibility and its conservative social agenda could perpetuate stigma and create barriers to care for veterans struggling with mental health issues.

**Real-World Consequences: A Betrayal of Trust**

The consequences of Project 2025's agenda for veterans would be devastating:

* **Longer Wait Times:**  Veterans would face longer wait times for appointments and treatments, as the VA struggles to keep up with demand.
* **Reduced Access to Care:**  Veterans could lose access to specialized care and services that are only available within the VA system.
* **Increased Financial Hardship:**  Disabled veterans could face increased financial hardship if their benefits are reduced or eliminated.
* **Higher Suicide Rates:**  The mental health crisis among veterans could worsen, leading to higher suicide rates.
* **Erosion of Trust:**  The weakening of the VA system could erode trust among veterans, making them less likely to seek the care and support they need.

**Call to Action:**

We must stand up for our veterans and fight back against Project 2025's betrayal:

* **Demand a Strong VA:**  Contact your elected officials and demand that they increase funding for the VA and oppose any efforts to privatize its services.
* **Support Veterans' Organizations:**  Donate to and volunteer with organizations like the DAV, the VFW, and the Wounded Warrior Project, which are fighting for veterans' rights.
* **Share Veterans' Stories:**  Amplify the voices of veterans who are struggling to access care and benefits, highlighting the human cost of Project 2025's agenda.
* **Vote in the 2024 Election:**  Make your voice heard and elect leaders who will prioritize the needs of veterans and defend the VA.

Our veterans deserve better than broken promises. We must ensure that they receive the care and support they earned through their service to our country.
