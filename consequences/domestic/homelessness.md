title: Criminalizing Compassion - Project 2025's Cruel Approach to Homelessness
---

**Introduction:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 don't offer solutions to homelessness; they offer scapegoating and punishment. This page exposes their cruel agenda, which would criminalize homelessness, strip away support services, and warehouse vulnerable individuals in "tent cities," further marginalizing those who are already struggling.

**Key Points:**

* **Criminalization Over Compassion:** The project frames homelessness as a problem of individual choice and a threat to public order, rather than a complex social issue rooted in poverty, mental illness, addiction, and lack of affordable housing.
    * **Banning Urban Camping:** Agenda 47 calls for banning urban camping and arresting those who violate the ban, criminalizing the act of sleeping on the streets. (Agenda 47, Social Issues)
    * **"Broken Windows" Policing:**  Project 2025 advocates for a "broken windows" approach to policing, which targets minor offenses like loitering and panhandling, often used to harass and displace homeless individuals. (Chapter 17)
    * **Blaming Immigrants:**  Both documents scapegoat immigrants for homelessness, falsely claiming that they are a drain on resources and contribute to the problem. (Agenda 47, Immigration Reforms)
* **Dismantling Support Services:**  Project 2025 proposes cutting funding for programs that provide housing, healthcare, and other essential services to homeless individuals, making it even harder for them to get back on their feet.
    * **Defunding HUD:**  They advocate for shrinking the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which funds affordable housing programs and homeless shelters. (Chapter 15)
    * **Restricting Access to Medicaid:**  They propose cutting Medicaid funding and tightening eligibility requirements, making it harder for homeless individuals to access healthcare. (Chapter 14)
    * **Ending "Housing First":**  They criticize the "Housing First" approach, which prioritizes providing permanent housing to homeless individuals without preconditions, arguing that it enables addiction and mental illness. (Chapter 15)
* **"Tent Cities": Warehousing the Vulnerable:**  Agenda 47 proposes creating "tent cities" to relocate homeless individuals, effectively warehousing them in segregated camps with limited access to services and opportunities. (Agenda 47, Social Issues)
* **Involuntary Commitment:**  The Lincoln Project transcript suggests that Trump could go even further, using the power of the state to involuntarily commit homeless individuals to mental institutions, even if they pose no threat to themselves or others.

**Real-World Consequences:**

* **Increased Homelessness:**  Criminalizing homelessness and cutting support services would likely lead to an increase in homelessness, as people are pushed further to the margins of society.
* **Worsening Health and Safety:**  Homeless individuals would face greater health and safety risks, as they are exposed to the elements, lack access to healthcare, and are more vulnerable to violence and exploitation.
* **Perpetuating a Cycle of Poverty:**  Without access to housing, healthcare, and other support services, it would be even harder for homeless individuals to escape poverty and rebuild their lives.
* **Erosion of Compassion and Empathy:**  A punitive approach to homelessness would erode compassion and empathy, creating a more callous and less humane society.

**Call to Action:**

We must reject Project 2025 and Agenda 47's cruel approach to homelessness and advocate for solutions that address the root causes of this crisis:

* **Support Housing First:**  Advocate for the "Housing First" approach, which has been proven effective in reducing chronic homelessness.
* **Increase Affordable Housing:**  Demand that elected officials invest in affordable housing, providing safe and stable homes for all Americans.
* **Expand Access to Healthcare and Mental Health Services:**  Ensure that homeless individuals have access to quality healthcare, including mental health and addiction treatment.
* **Challenge Criminalization:**  Oppose policies that criminalize homelessness and advocate for alternatives that focus on compassion and support.
* **Support Organizations Helping the Homeless:**  Donate to and volunteer with organizations like the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the Coalition for the Homeless, and local homeless shelters, which are working to provide housing and services to those in need.

Homelessness is a complex social problem that requires a compassionate and comprehensive response. We must not allow Project 2025 and Agenda 47 to turn their backs on our most vulnerable citizens.
