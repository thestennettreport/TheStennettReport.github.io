title: Dismantling Healthcare - A Blueprint for Undermining the Affordable Care Act and Eroding Access to Care - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 outline a plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, reduce the government's role in healthcare, and shift towards a market-based system that prioritizes profits over people, leaving millions of Americans without access to affordable care.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Undermining the Affordable Care Act (ACA):** The project seeks to weaken, dismantle, or repeal the ACA, stripping millions of Americans of their health insurance coverage and protections for pre-existing conditions.
* **Market-Based Solutions:** It champions a market-based approach to healthcare, ignoring the inherent flaws in the healthcare market and potentially leading to higher costs and reduced access for those who need it most.
* **Individual Responsibility:** It emphasizes individual responsibility for healthcare costs, shifting the burden onto patients and potentially discouraging them from seeking preventive care or treatment for chronic conditions.
* **State Control:**  Project 2025 advocates for shifting responsibility for healthcare to states, potentially creating a patchwork of inconsistent policies and a race to the bottom as states compete to cut costs.
* **Religious Exemptions:** It seeks to expand religious exemptions to healthcare laws, allowing providers and institutions to deny care based on their beliefs, potentially harming LGBTQ+ individuals, women seeking reproductive healthcare, and others.

**Critical Quote:**

"The Affordable Care Act has been a disaster. It has led to higher healthcare costs, fewer choices, and worse care for millions of Americans." <sup>([Chapter 14](../../project_2025/mandate_for_leadership/chapter_14.md))</sup>

**Why It Matters:**

This agenda threatens to reverse decades of progress in expanding healthcare coverage and could leave millions of Americans without access to affordable care, exacerbating health disparities and jeopardizing the well-being of our nation.

**Red Flags:**

* **Repealing or Weakening the ACA:**  Millions could lose their health insurance coverage and protections for pre-existing conditions.
* **Block Granting Medicaid:**  This could lead to cuts in services and eligibility, leaving low-income Americans without healthcare.
* **Expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs):**  This primarily benefits wealthier Americans and does little to address the underlying costs of healthcare.
* **Deregulating the Healthcare Market:**  This could lead to higher costs, reduced quality of care, and less consumer protection.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's healthcare agenda is a dangerous attack on the health and well-being of Americans, prioritizing profits over people and ideology over evidence-based policy. We must fight back to protect the Affordable Care Act, expand access to care, and ensure that healthcare is a right, not a privilege.
