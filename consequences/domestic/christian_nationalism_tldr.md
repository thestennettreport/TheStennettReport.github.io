title: The Threat of Christian Nationalism - A Distortion of History and a Danger to Democracy - TL;DR
---

**Overview:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 promote a dangerous Christian nationalist agenda, seeking to redefine America as a Christian nation, privilege Christianity over other religions, and undermine the separation of church and state.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Rewriting History:** Christian nationalists distort American history, falsely claiming the Founding Fathers intended a Christian nation, contradicting the Constitution and their writings.
* **Privileging Christianity:** The agenda seeks to inject Christian beliefs into government and public life, promoting Christian education, empowering faith-based organizations, and using religious exemptions to justify discrimination.
* **"Us vs. Them" Mentality:**  It fuels a divisive mentality, pitting Christians against secularists, liberals, and others, creating a climate of fear and intolerance.
* **Erosion of Religious Freedom:**  By imposing a Christian worldview, it threatens the religious freedom of all Americans, particularly those of other faiths or no faith.
* **Blurring Church and State:**  It undermines the separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, by injecting religious beliefs into government policy.

**Critical Quote:**

"The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion." (Treaty of Tripoli, 1797)

**Why It Matters:**

This agenda threatens the very foundation of our religiously diverse and inclusive democracy. It could lead to discrimination, the erosion of religious freedom, and increased social and political division.

**Red Flags:**

* **Mandating Christian Education:**  Pushing for a Christian nationalist curriculum in schools and empowering religious schools to discriminate.
* **Expanding Faith-Based Initiatives:**  Increasing the role of faith-based organizations in government programs, potentially leading to discrimination against those who don't share their beliefs.
* **Broadening Religious Exemptions:**  Allowing individuals and businesses to discriminate based on their religion, undermining anti-discrimination laws.

**Bottom Line:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47's embrace of Christian nationalism is a dangerous assault on religious freedom and the separation of church and state. We must defend our pluralistic democracy and ensure that America remains a nation where all faiths are respected and protected.
