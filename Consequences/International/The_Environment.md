##  A Scorched Earth Policy: Project 2025's Assault on Environmental Protection

**Introduction:**

Project 2025 and Agenda 47 don't just ignore the climate crisis; they actively embrace policies that would accelerate environmental destruction, pollute our air and water, and jeopardize the health of our planet for generations to come. This page exposes their scorched earth policy and its devastating consequences.

**Key Points:**

* **Climate Change Denial and Inaction:** The project dismisses the scientific consensus on climate change, promoting fossil fuels and hindering efforts to transition to a clean energy future.
    * **Gutting the EPA's Authority:**  They call for weakening or eliminating the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including rolling back the Clean Power Plan and challenging the agency's "Endangerment Finding." (Chapter 13)
    * **Fueling the Fossil Fuel Industry:**  They advocate for expanding oil and gas drilling on public lands and waters, incentivizing fossil fuel production, and removing regulations that promote clean energy. (Chapters 12 and 16)
    * **Abandoning International Agreements:**  They support withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, a global effort to combat climate change, signaling a rejection of international cooperation on this critical issue. (Agenda 47)
    * **Silencing Climate Scientists:**  They attack the credibility of climate scientists and promote misinformation about climate change, undermining public trust in science and hindering informed decision-making.
* **Weakening Environmental Regulations:**  Project 2025 advocates for a wholesale rollback of environmental regulations, jeopardizing the health of our air, water, and ecosystems:
    * **Gutting the Clean Air Act:**  They propose weakening or eliminating key provisions of the Clean Air Act, including those regulating air pollution from power plants, factories, and vehicles. (Chapter 13)
    * **Undermining the Clean Water Act:**  They seek to weaken the Clean Water Act, making it easier for polluters to discharge contaminants into our rivers, lakes, and streams. (Chapter 13)
    * **Endangering Species and Habitats:**  They advocate for weakening the Endangered Species Act, making it more difficult to protect endangered species and their habitats from development and exploitation. (Chapter 16)
* **Prioritizing Corporate Profits Over Environmental Protection:**  The project's core philosophy prioritizes corporate profits over environmental protection, viewing regulations as burdensome and unnecessary. This approach puts the interests of polluters ahead of the health and well-being of communities and the planet.
* **Disbanding NOAA:**  They propose disbanding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the agency responsible for monitoring climate change, providing weather forecasts, and managing fisheries. This would cripple our ability to understand and respond to environmental challenges. (Chapter 21)

**Real-World Consequences:**

* **Accelerated Climate Change:**  The project's policies would lead to a dramatic increase in greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating climate change and its devastating consequences, including more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and widespread environmental damage.
* **Increased Pollution:**  Weakening environmental regulations would lead to increased air and water pollution, harming public health, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color that are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards.
* **Loss of Biodiversity:**  Weakening the Endangered Species Act and promoting habitat destruction would lead to a loss of biodiversity, jeopardizing the delicate balance of ecosystems and threatening the survival of countless species.
* **Economic Costs:**  The long-term economic costs of environmental degradation, including healthcare expenses, property damage, and lost productivity, would far outweigh any short-term gains from deregulation.

**Call to Action:**

We must fight back against this assault on our environment:

* **Demand Climate Action:**  Urge elected officials to support policies that address climate change, transition to clean energy, and hold polluters accountable.
* **Defend Environmental Protections:**  Oppose efforts to weaken or eliminate environmental regulations and support organizations like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Environmental Defense Fund, which are fighting to protect our environment.
* **Hold Corporations Accountable:**  Demand that corporations adopt sustainable practices and reduce their environmental impact.
* **Educate Yourself and Others:**  Learn about the science of climate change and the importance of environmental protection, and share this information with your community.
* **Vote in the 2024 Election:**  Make your voice heard and elect leaders who will prioritize environmental protection and fight for a sustainable future.

The health of our planet and the well-being of future generations are at stake. We must act now to stop Project 2025's scorched earth policy.
