## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 15 Breakdown

**Chapter 15: Department of Housing and Urban Development**

**Author:** Dr. Benjamin S. Carson, Sr., MD, Former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), arguing that it has suffered from "mission creep" and has become a tool for promoting a progressive agenda. Carson advocates for a more limited role for HUD, emphasizing individual responsibility, upward mobility, and a reduction in government intervention in housing markets. He also calls for greater scrutiny of foreign ownership of U.S. real estate, particularly by China.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Resetting HUD:** Carson calls for "resetting" HUD by reversing the Biden Administration's "corrosive progressive ideologies" and refocusing the agency on its core mission of providing affordable housing. (Page 536)
    * **Concern:** This rhetoric could be used to justify cuts to HUD programs and a weakening of fair housing enforcement, potentially harming low-income families and minority communities.
    * **Quote:** "This effort should specifically include a broad reversal of the Biden Administration’s persistent implementation of corrosive progressive ideologies across the department’s programs."
* **Reversing "Mission Creep":** Carson criticizes HUD's "mission creep" and suggests that the federal government should play a smaller role in housing markets. (Page 537)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a decrease in funding for affordable housing programs and a weakening of the government's ability to address homelessness and housing discrimination.
* **Individual Responsibility and Upward Mobility:** Carson emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility and upward mobility, arguing that HUD programs should encourage self-sufficiency rather than dependence on government assistance. (Page 537)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a reduction in support for low-income families and a greater emphasis on work requirements and other policies that could make it more difficult for people to access affordable housing.
* **Scrutiny of Foreign Ownership:** Carson calls for greater oversight of foreign ownership of U.S. real estate, particularly by China, arguing that it poses a threat to national security and economic stability. (Page 537)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to discriminatory policies that target foreign investors, potentially harming the U.S. economy and discouraging foreign investment.
* **Eliminating "Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing":** Carson recommends repealing the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulation, arguing that it is an overreach of federal power and undermines local control. (Page 542)
    * **Concern:** This would weaken efforts to combat housing discrimination and could allow communities to perpetuate segregation and inequality.
* **Restricting Housing Assistance to Citizens:** Carson proposes prohibiting non-citizens from living in federally assisted housing, arguing that HUD's primary responsibility is to provide housing for American citizens. (Page 542)
    * **Concern:** This would discriminate against immigrants, including those who are legally present in the U.S., and could make it more difficult for mixed-status families to access affordable housing.

**Summary:**

Chapter 15 outlines a conservative vision for HUD that prioritizes a reduced federal role in housing markets, individual responsibility, and a crackdown on foreign ownership of U.S. real estate. The chapter's recommendations could lead to cuts in affordable housing programs, a weakening of fair housing enforcement, and discriminatory policies against immigrants. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased homelessness, housing discrimination, and a less equitable housing market under a future conservative administration.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Reduced Affordable Housing:** The proposals to "reset" HUD, reverse "mission creep," and restrict housing assistance to citizens could lead to a decrease in funding for affordable housing programs, potentially increasing homelessness and making it more difficult for low-income families to find decent housing.
* **Increased Housing Discrimination:** The repeal of the AFFH regulation and the weakening of fair housing enforcement could allow communities to perpetuate segregation and discrimination in housing.
* **Targeting of Immigrants:** The proposal to prohibit non-citizens from living in federally assisted housing would discriminate against immigrants and could harm mixed-status families.
* **Xenophobic Rhetoric:** The chapter's focus on foreign ownership of U.S. real estate, particularly by China, could be seen as xenophobic and could lead to discriminatory policies that target foreign investors.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, reflects the conservative agenda to reduce the role of the federal government in providing social services and to promote a more individualistic and less equitable approach to social policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly low-income families, minority communities, and immigrants, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less just and less compassionate society under a future conservative administration.
