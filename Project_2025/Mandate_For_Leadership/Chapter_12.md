## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 12 Breakdown

**[Chapter 12: Department of Energy and Related Commissions](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_12.pdf)**

**Author:** Bernard L. McNamee, Former Member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Energy (DOE) and related commissions, including FERC and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). McNamee argues that the Biden Administration's "extreme 'green' policies" have created an "artificial energy scarcity" and driven up energy prices. He outlines a conservative vision for American energy policy that emphasizes "energy dominance," an "all of the above" approach, and a reduced role for government in energy markets.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **"American Energy Dominance":** McNamee calls for a return to "American energy dominance," arguing that the U.S. should prioritize the production of fossil fuels to ensure abundant, affordable, and reliable energy.
    * **Concern:** This suggests a disregard for the environmental consequences of fossil fuel production, potentially exacerbating climate change and harming public health.
* **"All of the Above" Energy Policy:** McNamee advocates for an "all of the above" energy policy, but his emphasis is clearly on fossil fuels.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a continued reliance on fossil fuels at the expense of investments in renewable energy sources, hindering efforts to transition to a cleaner energy future.
* **Repealing Green Subsidies:** McNamee calls for repealing subsidies for renewable energy and ending government support for the "transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
    * **Concern:** This would make it more difficult for renewable energy sources to compete with fossil fuels, potentially slowing down the development and deployment of clean energy technologies.
* **Unleashing Private-Sector Innovation:** McNamee argues that the government should "end government interference in energy decisions" and "unleash private-sector energy innovation."
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a rollback of regulations that protect consumers and the environment, potentially resulting in higher energy prices, unsafe energy practices, and increased pollution.
* **Refocusing FERC and NRC:** McNamee calls for refocusing FERC on ensuring "affordable and reliable electricity" and for streamlining the NRC's nuclear regulatory requirements to promote the development of new nuclear power plants.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a weakening of environmental regulations and safety standards for energy production and transportation, potentially putting communities at risk.
* **Security and Resilience:** McNamee emphasizes the need to secure energy infrastructure from cyber and physical attacks, but he does not address the role of climate change in increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which also threaten energy infrastructure.
    * **Concern:** This suggests a narrow focus on traditional security threats at the expense of addressing the growing risks posed by climate change.

**Summary:**

Chapter 12 outlines a conservative vision for American energy policy that prioritizes fossil fuel production, deregulation, and a reduced role for government in energy markets. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a rollback of environmental protections, a slowdown in the development of renewable energy sources, and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for exacerbating climate change and harming public health.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Exacerbating Climate Change:** The emphasis on fossil fuel production and the rollback of renewable energy subsidies could lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and its associated risks.
* **Weakening Environmental Protections:** The call for deregulation and a reduced role for government in energy markets could lead to a weakening of environmental protections, potentially increasing pollution and harming public health.
* **Higher Energy Prices:** The elimination of renewable energy subsidies and the focus on fossil fuels could lead to higher energy prices for consumers and businesses.
* **Slower Innovation:** The rollback of government support for clean energy technologies could slow down innovation and the development of new renewable energy sources.
* **Ignoring Climate Risks:** The chapter's narrow focus on traditional security threats ignores the growing risks to energy infrastructure posed by climate change-related extreme weather events.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, highlights the stark differences between conservatives and liberals on issues of energy and environmental policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the future of America's energy system and its contribution to climate change, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a more polluting and less sustainable energy future under a future conservative administration.
