title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 11
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Education](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_11.pdf)

**Author:** Lindsey M. Burke, Director of the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation

Chapter 11 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the U.S. Department of Education (ED), arguing that federal involvement in education has failed to improve student outcomes and has created a burdensome bureaucracy. Authored by Lindsey M. Burke, Director of the Center for Education Policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, the chapter advocates for a significantly reduced federal role in education, ultimately calling for the elimination of the Department of Education and a return to state and local control. She emphasizes empowering families through school choice policies, particularly Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), and promoting a conservative social agenda in education.

The chapter's significance lies in its radical proposal to eliminate the Department of Education, a move that would represent a dramatic shift in federal education policy. Burke's recommendations could lead to a significant decrease in funding for public schools, a widening of the achievement gap between wealthy and poor students, and a greater influence of private and religious schools in education. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the future of public education and the potential for a two-tiered system that benefits wealthy families at the expense of low-income families.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Eliminate the Department of Education:** Burke's central recommendation is to eliminate the Department of Education, arguing that it is unnecessary, ineffective, and harmful to local control of education. This reflects a broader conservative distrust of the federal government and a belief that education should be primarily a state and local responsibility.
* **School Choice:** The chapter strongly advocates for school choice policies, particularly Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), which would allow parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, tutoring, and other educational expenses. This aligns with the broader conservative goal of promoting market-based solutions in education and reducing the role of traditional public schools.
* **Parental Rights:** Burke emphasizes the importance of parental rights in education, arguing that parents should have greater control over their children's education and that the government should not interfere with their choices. This reflects a conservative belief in individual liberty and limited government.
* **Conservative Social Agenda:** The chapter promotes a conservative social agenda in education, including opposition to critical race theory, "gender ideology," and comprehensive sex education. This aligns with the broader conservative movement's focus on cultural issues and its opposition to what it perceives as "woke" ideology in education.
* **"Federal" Children:** Burke argues that the federal government has a special responsibility to provide school choice options for children in military families, the District of Columbia, and tribal communities, suggesting that these children should not be limited to attending traditional public schools.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: The Failure of Federal Involvement <sup>346</sup>**

* Burke argues that federal involvement in education has failed to improve student outcomes and has created a burdensome bureaucracy.
* She criticizes the Department of Education for its "one-size-fits-all" approach to education and its "top-down mandates."
* **Quote:** "The federal government's involvement in education has been a costly failure. It has not improved student outcomes, and it has created a massive bureaucracy that is accountable to no one."

**3.2 The Solution: Empowering Families <sup>353</sup>**

* Burke advocates for a more decentralized approach to education, emphasizing parental choice and local control.
* She calls for eliminating the Department of Education and for replacing it with a system of block grants to states.
* **Quote:** "The best way to improve education is to empower families and to give them more control over their children's education."

**3.3 Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) <sup>353</sup>**

* Burke strongly advocates for ESAs, which would allow parents to use public funds to pay for a wide range of educational expenses, including private school tuition, tutoring, online courses, and educational materials.
* She argues that ESAs would give parents greater control over their children's education and would foster competition and innovation in the education market.
* **Quote:** "Education Savings Accounts are the most promising school choice policy available today. They would give parents the power to customize their children's education and to choose the best options for their individual needs."

**3.4 School Choice for "Federal" Children <sup>355</sup>**

* Burke calls for expanding school choice options for children in military families, the District of Columbia, and tribal communities, arguing that the federal government has a special responsibility to these students.
* She proposes creating new voucher programs and expanding existing ones to give these children greater access to private schools.

**3.5 Protecting Parental Rights <sup>377</sup>**

* Burke emphasizes the importance of parental rights in education, arguing that parents should have the right to:
    * **Choose their children's schools:**  Whether public, private, or homeschooling.
    * **Review and approve curriculum:**  Ensuring that it aligns with their values and beliefs.
    * **Access their children's educational records.**
    * **Opt their children out of activities that they object to.**
* She calls for a federal Parents' Bill of Rights to codify these rights.

**3.6 Civil Rights and "Equity" <sup>368</sup>**

* Burke criticizes the Obama Administration's guidance on school discipline, arguing that it led to a focus on "racial parity" over student safety.
* She also calls for rescinding the Equity in IDEA regulation, which requires states to consider race and ethnicity in special education services.
* **Quote:** "The Obama Administration's focus on 'equity' in education led to a number of harmful policies that undermined student safety and academic achievement."

**3.7 Conclusion: A Vision for Educational Freedom <sup>380</sup>**

* Burke concludes by outlining a vision for educational freedom, where parents have the power to choose their children's schools and to direct their education.
* She argues that this approach will lead to better outcomes for students and a more vibrant and innovative education system.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 11 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for education policy that prioritizes school choice, parental rights, and a reduced federal role. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a significant shift in funding away from public schools and toward private schools, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in education. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the future of public education and the potential for a two-tiered system that benefits wealthy families at the expense of low-income families.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reveals a consistent pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to reduce the role of the federal government in providing social services and to shift power away from public institutions and toward private individuals and organizations. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the future of American education, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less effective education system under a future conservative administration.
