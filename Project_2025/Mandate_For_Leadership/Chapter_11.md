## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 11 Breakdown

**Chapter 11: Department of Education**

**Author:** Lindsey M. Burke, Director of the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the U.S. Department of Education (ED), arguing that federal involvement in education has failed to improve student outcomes and has created a burdensome bureaucracy. Burke advocates for a limited federal role in education, ultimately calling for the elimination of the Department of Education and a return to state and local control. She emphasizes empowering families through school choice policies, particularly Education Savings Accounts (ESAs).

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Eliminate the Department of Education:** Burke's ultimate goal is to eliminate the Department of Education, arguing that it is unnecessary and harmful. (Page 353)
    * **Concern:** This would represent a radical shift in federal education policy, potentially leading to a decrease in funding for public schools and a widening of the achievement gap between wealthy and poor students.
    * **Quote:** "Federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated."
* **Education Savings Accounts (ESAs):** Burke strongly advocates for ESAs, which allow parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, tutoring, and other educational expenses. (Page 353)
    * **Concern:** This would divert public funds away from public schools and could lead to a two-tiered education system, with wealthy families able to afford better educational options than low-income families.
* **School Choice for "Federal" Children:** Burke calls for expanding school choice options for children in military families, the District of Columbia, and tribal communities, arguing that the federal government has a special responsibility to these students. (Page 355)
    * **Concern:** This could further undermine public schools in these communities and lead to a decrease in funding and resources for those schools.
* **Block Grants to States:** Burke advocates for block granting federal education funds to states, giving them greater flexibility in how they spend those funds. (Page 355)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a decrease in accountability and oversight of federal education funds, potentially allowing states to use those funds for purposes other than education or to discriminate against certain groups of students.
* **Protecting Parental Rights:** Burke emphasizes the importance of parental rights in education and calls for a federal Parents' Bill of Rights that would give parents greater control over their children's education. (Page 377)
    * **Concern:** This could be used to justify policies that allow parents to opt their children out of curriculum that they disagree with, potentially undermining efforts to promote tolerance and diversity in schools.
* **Civil Rights Enforcement:** Burke criticizes the Obama Administration's guidance on school discipline, arguing that it led to a focus on "racial parity" over student safety. She also calls for rescinding the Equity in IDEA regulation, which requires states to consider race and ethnicity in special education services. (Page 368)
    * **Concern:** These proposals could weaken protections for minority students and make it more difficult to address racial disparities in education.

**Summary:**

Chapter 11 outlines a conservative vision for education policy that prioritizes school choice, parental rights, and a reduced federal role. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a significant shift in funding away from public schools and toward private schools, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in education. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the future of public education and the potential for a two-tiered system that benefits wealthy families at the expense of low-income families.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Defunding Public Schools:** The proposals to eliminate the Department of Education, expand ESAs, and block grant federal funds to states could lead to a significant decrease in funding for public schools, potentially harming the quality of education for millions of children.
* **Exacerbating Inequality:** The emphasis on school choice could lead to a two-tiered education system, with wealthy families able to afford better educational options than low-income families.
* **Undermining Teacher Unions:** The chapter's focus on parental rights and school choice could be seen as an attack on teacher unions, which are a major source of support for Democrats.
* **Weakening Civil Rights Protections:** The proposals to roll back Obama-era guidance on school discipline and special education could weaken protections for minority students and make it more difficult to address racial disparities in education.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reveals a consistent pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to reduce the role of the federal government in providing social services and to shift power away from public institutions and toward private individuals and organizations. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the future of American education, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less effective education system under a future conservative administration.
