title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 15 - Department of Housing and Urban Development
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of Housing and Urban Development](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_15.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_15_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Dr. Benjamin S. Carson, Sr., MD, Former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

Chapter 15 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), arguing that it has suffered from "mission creep" and has become a tool for promoting a progressive social agenda. Authored by Dr. Ben Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon and former Secretary of HUD under President Trump, the chapter advocates for a significantly reduced role for HUD, emphasizing individual responsibility, upward mobility, and a reduction in government intervention in housing markets. He also calls for greater scrutiny of foreign ownership of U.S. real estate, particularly by China, echoing a recurring theme of economic and national security concerns related to China throughout Project 2025.

The chapter's significance lies in its vision for a more market-driven approach to housing policy, with a reduced emphasis on government assistance and a greater focus on individual initiative. Carson's recommendations could lead to cuts in affordable housing programs, a weakening of fair housing enforcement, and discriminatory policies against immigrants. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased homelessness, housing discrimination, and a less equitable housing market under a future conservative administration.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Individual Responsibility:** Carson emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility and self-sufficiency, arguing that HUD programs should encourage people to become independent rather than reliant on government assistance. This reflects a broader conservative belief in limited government and a skepticism towards social welfare programs.
* **Upward Mobility:** The chapter promotes the idea of upward mobility, arguing that HUD should focus on helping people move out of poverty rather than simply providing them with housing assistance. This aligns with the conservative belief in the American Dream and the idea that anyone can achieve success through hard work and determination.
* **Free Markets:** Carson advocates for a more market-driven approach to housing, arguing that the government should not interfere with the free market's ability to provide affordable housing. This reflects a broader conservative preference for deregulation and a belief that the private sector is more efficient than the government.
* **Scrutiny of Foreign Ownership:** The chapter calls for greater scrutiny of foreign ownership of U.S. real estate, particularly by China, arguing that it poses a threat to national security and economic stability. This echoes a recurring theme in Project 2025 of viewing China as a strategic competitor and a potential threat.
* **Local Control:** Carson advocates for greater local control over housing policy, arguing that communities should have more flexibility to address their own housing needs. This reflects a broader conservative preference for decentralization and a distrust of federal power.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on individual responsibility, upward mobility, and a reduced role for government aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 3](./chapter_3.md):**  This chapter, focusing on central personnel agencies, complements Chapter 15 by advocating for weakening civil service protections and making it easier to fire federal employees who do not align with the President's agenda, potentially allowing for a purge of HUD employees who support a more expansive role for the agency.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 21](./chapter_21.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Commerce, supports Chapter 15 by calling for greater scrutiny of foreign investment in the U.S., including real estate, particularly from China.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Reduced Affordable Housing:**  The proposals to "reset" HUD, reverse "mission creep," and restrict housing assistance to citizens could lead to a decrease in funding for affordable housing programs, potentially increasing homelessness and making it more difficult for low-income families to find decent housing.
* **Increased Housing Discrimination:**  The repeal of the AFFH regulation and the weakening of fair housing enforcement could allow communities to perpetuate segregation and discrimination in housing, particularly against minority groups and immigrants.
* **Targeting of Immigrants:**  The proposal to prohibit non-citizens from living in federally assisted housing would discriminate against immigrants, including those who are legally present in the U.S., and could harm mixed-status families.
* **Xenophobic Rhetoric:**  The chapter's focus on foreign ownership of U.S. real estate, particularly by China, could be seen as xenophobic and could lead to discriminatory policies that target foreign investors, potentially harming the U.S. economy and discouraging foreign investment.
* **Exacerbation of Inequality:**  The emphasis on individual responsibility and upward mobility, without addressing systemic barriers to housing affordability and access, could exacerbate existing inequalities and make it even harder for low-income families and marginalized communities to find safe and stable housing.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Ignoring Systemic Barriers:**  Critics might argue that the chapter's focus on individual responsibility ignores the systemic barriers to housing affordability and access, such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of affordable housing options.
* **Weakening Fair Housing Protections:**  Opponents might argue that repealing the AFFH regulation and restricting housing assistance to citizens would weaken fair housing protections and make it easier for landlords and communities to discriminate against minority groups and immigrants.
* **Exacerbating Homelessness:**  Critics might argue that reducing funding for affordable housing programs and promoting a more market-driven approach to housing would exacerbate homelessness, particularly among vulnerable populations.
* **Promoting Xenophobia:**  Opponents might argue that the chapter's focus on foreign ownership of U.S. real estate is xenophobic and could lead to discriminatory policies that harm the U.S. economy and discourage foreign investment.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 15 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for HUD that prioritizes a reduced federal role in housing markets, individual responsibility, and a crackdown on foreign ownership of U.S. real estate. The chapter's recommendations could lead to cuts in affordable housing programs, a weakening of fair housing enforcement, and discriminatory policies against immigrants. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased homelessness, housing discrimination, and a less equitable housing market under a future conservative administration.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, reflects the conservative agenda to reduce the role of the federal government in providing social services and to promote a more individualistic and less equitable approach to social policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly low-income families, minority communities, and immigrants, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less just and less compassionate society under a future conservative administration.
