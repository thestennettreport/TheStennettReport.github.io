## Mandate for Leadership - "Onward!" Breakdown

**Section: Onward!**

**Author:** Edwin J. Feulner, Founder and Former President of The Heritage Foundation

**Introduction:**

This concluding section, titled "[Onward!](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/Onward.pdf)," serves as a call to action for conservatives to continue the fight for limited government, free markets, and traditional American values. Feulner recounts the history of the "Mandate for Leadership" project, highlighting its impact on the Reagan and Trump Administrations. He argues that the 2025 edition of Mandate provides a roadmap for the next conservative President to reverse the "economic, military, cultural, and foreign policy turmoil" of the Biden years and to restore America's greatness.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Mandate as a Blueprint for Conservative Revolution:** Feulner presents "Mandate for Leadership" as a blueprint for a conservative revolution, arguing that it provides a comprehensive plan to dismantle the administrative state, reduce the size and scope of government, and advance conservative policies across all areas of government.
    * **Concern:** This suggests a radical agenda that could fundamentally alter the role of the federal government and undermine decades of progress in areas such as social welfare, environmental protection, and civil rights.
* **"People are Policy":** Feulner emphasizes the importance of personnel in implementing a conservative agenda, arguing that the next President must appoint individuals who are "principled" and "aligned with the Presidentâ€™s conservative vision."
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a politicization of the federal workforce and a disregard for expertise and experience, potentially resulting in a less effective and less accountable government.
* **"Watch the Watchers":** Feulner argues that presidential appointees must serve as "watchdogs" to "rein in" federal agencies and prevent them from overreaching their authority. He specifically mentions the EPA, IRS, and OSHA as agencies that need to be reined in.
    * **Concern:** This suggests a deep distrust of federal agencies and a desire to weaken their ability to carry out their missions, potentially undermining important government functions such as environmental protection, tax enforcement, and workplace safety.
* **Conservative Solutions vs. Liberal Failures:** Feulner repeatedly contrasts "conservative solutions" with "liberal policies," arguing that conservative policies are more effective in promoting economic growth, individual freedom, and national security.
    * **Concern:** This rhetoric oversimplifies complex policy issues and ignores the successes of liberal policies in areas such as social welfare, education, and health care. It also suggests a partisan bias that could lead to a disregard for evidence and a rejection of compromise.

**Summary:**

"Onward!" serves as a rallying cry for conservatives, urging them to embrace the "Mandate for Leadership" as a guide for achieving a conservative revolution in government. The section celebrates the successes of the Reagan and Trump Administrations in implementing conservative policies and suggests that the next conservative President can achieve similar results by following the recommendations outlined in Mandate. This vision of a radically transformed federal government, with a weakened administrative state and a more limited role in addressing social and economic problems, is likely to be deeply concerning to Democrats.

**Why This Section Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Radical Agenda:** The section's embrace of "Mandate for Leadership" as a blueprint for a conservative revolution suggests a radical agenda that could fundamentally alter the role of the federal government and undermine decades of progress in areas such as social welfare, environmental protection, and civil rights.
* **Politicization of Government:** The emphasis on appointing "principled" individuals who are aligned with the President's conservative vision could lead to a politicization of the federal workforce and a disregard for expertise and experience.
* **Weakening of Federal Agencies:** The call to "watch the watchers" and to "rein in" federal agencies suggests a deep distrust of government and a desire to weaken its ability to carry out its missions.
* **Partisan Bias:** The section's rhetoric contrasting "conservative solutions" with "liberal failures" suggests a partisan bias that could lead to a disregard for evidence and a rejection of compromise.

"Onward!" leaves no doubt about the conservative movement's ambition to reshape the federal government in its image. The vision articulated in this section is one of a smaller, less intrusive government that prioritizes free markets, individual responsibility, and traditional values over government intervention, social welfare, and environmental protection. This vision is fundamentally at odds with the Democratic Party's platform and priorities, raising serious concerns about the potential for a less just and less equitable society under a future conservative administration.
