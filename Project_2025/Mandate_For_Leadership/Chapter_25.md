title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 25 - Small Business Administration
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Small Business Administration](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_25.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_25_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Karen Kerrigan, President and CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council

Chapter 25 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Small Business Administration (SBA), arguing that it has become a "sprawling, unaccountable agency" plagued by "waste, fraud, and mismanagement." Authored by Karen Kerrigan, a long-time advocate for small businesses and president of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, the chapter criticizes the agency's "mission creep" and its focus on "inclusivity" initiatives that she believes are actually creating "exclusivity" and hindering entrepreneurship. She outlines a plan to reform the SBA, making it more accountable, efficient, and focused on its core mission of supporting small business growth, primarily through reducing its size and scope, ending direct lending, and promoting a more market-oriented approach.

The chapter's significance lies in its reflection of a broader conservative skepticism towards government intervention in the economy, even when it comes to supporting small businesses. Kerrigan's recommendations could lead to a decrease in funding for SBA programs, a greater reliance on private lenders, and a weakening of efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less supportive and less equitable environment for small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities, who often face greater challenges in accessing capital and resources.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Limited Government:** Kerrigan emphasizes the need for a smaller and less intrusive SBA, arguing that the agency has expanded beyond its core mission and has become too involved in picking winners and losers in the marketplace. This reflects a broader conservative belief in limited government and a preference for free markets over government intervention.
* **Free Markets:** The chapter advocates for a more market-oriented approach to supporting small businesses, arguing that the private sector is better equipped to provide capital and resources to entrepreneurs. This aligns with the conservative belief that the free market is the most efficient mechanism for allocating resources and promoting economic growth.
* **Accountability and Transparency:** Kerrigan stresses the importance of accountability and transparency at the SBA, calling for stricter performance metrics, more rigorous oversight, and a full accounting of COVID-19 relief program spending. While accountability is important, this could also be used to justify cuts to SBA programs and to increase privatization.
* **Criticism of "Inclusivity" Initiatives:** Kerrigan criticizes the SBA's focus on "inclusivity" initiatives, arguing that they are actually creating "exclusivity" and are not reaching all eligible small businesses. This suggests a disregard for the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship and could lead to a decrease in support for minority-owned and women-owned businesses.
* **Focus on Core Functions:** The chapter calls for the SBA to focus on its core functions of providing access to capital, entrepreneurial development, and government contracting support, suggesting that other programs should be eliminated or consolidated. This reflects a desire to streamline the agency and to reduce its involvement in areas that conservatives view as outside its core mandate.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Reduced Support for Small Businesses:** The proposals to shrink the SBA, end direct lending, and focus on core functions could lead to a decrease in overall support for small businesses, making it more difficult for entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses, particularly those in underserved communities or those owned by women and minorities.
* **Harm to Underserved Communities:** The elimination of direct lending and the emphasis on private lenders could make it more difficult for small businesses in underserved communities to access capital, potentially exacerbating existing economic disparities.
* **Weakening of Regulations:** A more powerful Office of Advocacy could be used to weaken regulations that protect consumers, workers, and the environment, potentially harming the public interest.
* **Decreased Focus on Diversity and Inclusion:** The criticism of "inclusivity" initiatives suggests a disregard for the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship and could lead to a decrease in support for minority-owned and women-owned businesses.
* **Increased Reliance on Predatory Lenders:**  Ending direct lending could push small businesses towards predatory lenders who charge higher interest rates and fees, potentially trapping them in a cycle of debt.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 25 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for the SBA that prioritizes efficiency, accountability, and a reduced role for government in supporting small businesses. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a decrease in funding for SBA programs, a greater reliance on private lenders, and a weakening of efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less supportive and less equitable environment for small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities.

This chapter, like the previous chapters, reflects the conservative agenda to reduce the role of the federal government in supporting economic development and promoting social equity. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the vitality of the small business sector, which is a major engine of job creation and economic growth, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less dynamic and less inclusive economy under a future conservative administration.
