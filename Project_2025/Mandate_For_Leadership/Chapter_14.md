## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 14 Breakdown

**[Chapter 14: Department of Health and Human Services](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_14.pdf)**

**Author:** Roger Severino, Former Director of the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), arguing that it has strayed from its mission of serving "all Americans from conception to natural death" and has become a tool for promoting a "woke" agenda under the Biden Administration. Severino outlines a conservative vision for HHS that prioritizes protecting life, empowering patient choices, promoting traditional families, preparing for future health emergencies, and increasing transparency and accountability.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Protecting Life, Conscience, and Bodily Integrity:** Severino calls for a robust agenda to protect the "fundamental right to life," conscience rights, and "bodily integrity rooted in biological realities, not ideology."
    * **Concern:** This language signals a strong anti-abortion stance and a rejection of transgender rights, potentially leading to policies that restrict access to reproductive health care and discriminate against transgender individuals.
* **Empowering Patient Choices and Provider Autonomy:** Severino advocates for patient-centered, market-based health care reform that empowers individuals to control their health care decisions and reduces government regulation.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a weakening of consumer protections and a shift away from a universal health care system, potentially making health care less affordable and accessible for low-income Americans.
* **Promoting Stable and Flourishing Married Families:** Severino emphasizes the importance of "stable and flourishing married families" and criticizes policies that "subsidize single-motherhood, disincentivize work, and penalize marriage."
    * **Concern:** This suggests a narrow and traditional view of family structures, potentially leading to policies that discriminate against single parents, LGBTQ+ families, and other non-traditional families.
* **Preparing for the Next Health Emergency:** Severino criticizes the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as "centralized and politicized" and calls for a more "transparent, scientifically grounded" approach to future health emergencies.
    * **Concern:** This rhetoric could be used to downplay the severity of future pandemics and to justify a less robust public health response.
* **Instituting Greater Transparency, Accountability, and Oversight:** Severino calls for greater transparency and accountability at HHS, including eliminating conflicts of interest between government regulators and the pharmaceutical industry and adopting metrics to measure the effectiveness of HHS programs.
    * **Concern:** While transparency and accountability are important, this could also be used to justify cuts to HHS programs and to undermine the agency's ability to regulate the health care industry.

**Specific Agency Recommendations & Concerns:**

* **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):** Severino criticizes the CDC's performance during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for splitting it into two separate agencies: one for data collection and one for public health recommendations. He also advocates for eliminating the CDC Foundation, which accepts funding from pharmaceutical companies.
    * **Concern:** This could weaken the CDC's ability to respond effectively to public health emergencies and could make it more difficult to coordinate public health efforts across the country.
* **Food and Drug Administration (FDA):** Severino criticizes the FDA's approval of chemical abortion drugs and its regulation of generic drugs. He calls for reversing the approval of abortion drugs, strengthening safety protocols for mifepristone, and addressing drug shortages.
    * **Concern:** These proposals would restrict access to abortion care and could make it more difficult for consumers to access affordable generic drugs.
* **National Institutes of Health (NIH):** Severino criticizes the NIH for funding research using fetal tissue and embryonic stem cells and for its ties to the pharmaceutical industry. He calls for ending such research, imposing term limits on NIH leadership, and eliminating the NIH Foundation.
    * **Concern:** This could stifle important medical research and undermine the NIH's ability to develop new treatments and cures for diseases.

**Summary:**

Chapter 14 outlines a conservative vision for HHS that prioritizes a pro-life agenda, limited government intervention in health care, and a traditional view of family structures. The chapter's recommendations could have a significant impact on access to reproductive health care, the affordability and accessibility of health insurance, and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and families. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less inclusive and less equitable health care system under a future conservative administration.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Restrictions on Abortion Access:** The chapter's strong anti-abortion stance and its specific recommendations regarding the FDA and CMS suggest a concerted effort to restrict access to abortion care.
* **Weakening of the Affordable Care Act:** The chapter's advocacy for patient-centered, market-based health care reform and its criticism of the ACA suggest a desire to weaken or dismantle the law, potentially making health insurance less affordable and accessible for millions of Americans.
* **Discrimination Against LGBTQ+ Individuals and Families:** The chapter's emphasis on "stable and flourishing married families" and its criticism of policies that support non-traditional families suggest a willingness to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals and families.
* **Inadequate Public Health Response:** The chapter's criticism of the government's COVID-19 response and its call for a more limited role for the CDC in future health emergencies could lead to a less effective response to future pandemics.
* **Undermining Scientific Research:** The chapter's opposition to research using fetal tissue and embryonic stem cells could stifle important medical research and hinder the development of new treatments and cures for diseases.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, provides a clear picture of the conservative agenda for reshaping the federal government. The proposals outlined in this chapter would have a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly women, low-income families, and LGBTQ+ individuals, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less just and less equitable society under a future conservative administration.
