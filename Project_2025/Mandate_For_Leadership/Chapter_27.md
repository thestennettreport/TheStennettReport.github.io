title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 27 - Financial Regulatory Agencies
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Financial Regulatory Agencies](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_27.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_27_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** David R. Burton, Senior Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation

Chapter 27 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on financial regulatory agencies, specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and self-regulatory organizations (SROs) like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Authored by David R. Burton, a senior fellow in economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, the chapter argues that the Biden Administration is using these agencies to advance a radical agenda that harms investors, stifles capital formation, and undermines free markets. Burton outlines a conservative vision for financial regulation that prioritizes deregulation, a reduced role for government, and a rejection of efforts to promote corporate social responsibility and address climate change through financial regulation.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a significant weakening of financial regulations and a return to a more laissez-faire approach to financial markets. Burton's recommendations could lead to a less stable and more risky financial system, potentially increasing risks for investors, making the financial system more vulnerable to crises, and reducing transparency and accountability in the industry. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a return to the kind of lax regulation that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis and a disregard for the systemic risks posed by climate change and corporate misconduct.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Deregulation and Free Markets:** Burton emphasizes the importance of free markets and deregulation, arguing that excessive government regulation stifles innovation, economic growth, and capital formation. This reflects a broader conservative belief in the efficiency of markets and a skepticism towards government intervention in the economy.
* **Limited Government:** The chapter advocates for a significantly reduced role for government in financial markets, arguing that the private sector is better equipped to allocate capital and manage risk. This aligns with the conservative principle of limited government and a belief that individuals and businesses should be free to make their own decisions without government interference.
* **Criticism of "Woke" Agenda:** Burton criticizes the SEC's efforts to require companies to disclose climate-related risks and to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), arguing that these are examples of a "woke" agenda that is being imposed on businesses and investors. This reflects a broader conservative backlash against what they perceive as "woke capitalism" and a desire to prevent the government from using its regulatory power to advance a social agenda.
* **Focus on Shareholder Value:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of shareholder value, arguing that the primary purpose of corporations is to maximize profits for their shareholders. This aligns with the traditional conservative view of corporate governance and a rejection of stakeholder capitalism, which considers the interests of a broader range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the community.
* **Skepticism Towards ESG:** Burton explicitly opposes the use of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in investment decisions, arguing that it is a form of "political correctness" that distorts markets and harms investors. This reflects a broader conservative skepticism towards ESG investing and a belief that it is driven by ideology rather than sound financial principles.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on deregulation, limited government, and a rejection of "woke" policies aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 2](./chapter_2.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Executive Office of the President, complements Chapter 27 by advocating for using the OMB to control agency budgets and regulations, potentially weakening financial regulatory agencies.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 22](./chapter_22.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of the Treasury, supports Chapter 27 by calling for a more conservative approach to fiscal policy and a reduction in the role of government in the economy, which would align with a deregulatory agenda for financial markets.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Weakening of Financial Regulations:**  The proposals to deregulate financial markets, reduce the role of government, and abolish or weaken SROs could lead to a less stable and more risky financial system, potentially increasing risks for investors, making the financial system more vulnerable to crises, and reducing transparency and accountability in the industry.
* **Increased Risk of Fraud and Misconduct:**  The proposals to simplify securities laws and limit the SEC's enforcement powers could make it easier for companies to engage in fraud and other misconduct, potentially harming investors and eroding public trust in financial markets.
* **Disregard for Climate Change:**  The criticism of the SEC's climate change disclosure rule suggests a disregard for the risks posed by climate change to the financial system and could discourage businesses from taking steps to address those risks, potentially leading to greater financial instability in the long run.
* **Opposition to Corporate Social Responsibility:**  The explicit rejection of ESG and other concepts related to corporate social responsibility suggests a belief that businesses should prioritize profits over all other considerations, potentially leading to harmful social and environmental consequences and undermining efforts to promote sustainable and ethical business practices.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Increased Risk of Financial Crisis:**  Critics might argue that deregulation and a reduced role for government in financial markets would increase the risk of another financial crisis, similar to the 2008 crisis, which was caused in part by lax regulation and excessive risk-taking by financial institutions.
* **Harm to Investors:**  Opponents might argue that weakening investor protections and limiting the SEC's enforcement powers would make investors more vulnerable to fraud and abuse by corporations.
* **Ignoring Systemic Risks:**  Critics might argue that the chapter's focus on deregulation ignores the systemic risks posed by climate change and other global challenges, which could have significant impacts on the financial system.
* **Corporate Capture:**  Opponents might argue that the chapter's recommendations would benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals at the expense of ordinary Americans, potentially leading to greater inequality and a concentration of economic power.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 27 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for financial regulation that prioritizes deregulation, a reduced role for government, and a rejection of efforts to promote corporate social responsibility and address climate change through financial regulation. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a weaker and less effective regulatory system, potentially increasing risks for investors and making the financial system more vulnerable to crises. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a return to the kind of lax regulation that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis and a disregard for the systemic risks posed by climate change and corporate misconduct.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reinforces the pattern of "Project 2025" to promote a conservative agenda that prioritizes free markets, limited government, and individual responsibility over government intervention, social welfare, and environmental protection. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the stability and fairness of the U.S. financial system, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less regulated and less equitable financial system under a future conservative administration.
