## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 9 Breakdown

**Chapter 9: Agency for International Development**

**Author:** Max Primorac, Former Acting Chief Operating Officer and Assistant to the Administrator at USAID

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the federal agency responsible for administering U.S. foreign aid. Primorac argues that the Biden Administration has "deformed" USAID by using it to promote a "divisive political and cultural agenda" that includes abortion, climate extremism, and gender radicalism. He outlines a plan to "deradicalize" USAID, reduce its global footprint, and refocus it on promoting conservative values and American interests.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **"Deradicalizing" USAID:** Primorac calls for "deradicalizing" USAID by eliminating programs and initiatives related to abortion, climate change, and gender equality, arguing that these are "divisive" and "harmful."
    * **Concern:** This would represent a significant shift in U.S. foreign aid policy, potentially undermining efforts to promote women's rights, combat climate change, and provide essential health services in developing countries.
* **Countering China:** Primorac emphasizes the need to counter China's growing influence in the developing world and calls for restoring the Trump Administration's "Clear Choice" initiative, which contrasted American values with Chinese "authoritarianism."
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a more confrontational and less cooperative approach to development assistance, potentially undermining efforts to address global challenges like poverty and disease.
* **Promoting Conservative Social Values:** Primorac advocates for using USAID to promote conservative social values, such as opposition to abortion and support for traditional families.
    * **Concern:** This could alienate partners and beneficiaries who do not share those values and undermine USAID's effectiveness in promoting development and humanitarian assistance.
* **Reducing Foreign Aid:** Primorac calls for scaling back USAID's global footprint and returning to its 2019 budget level, arguing that the Biden Administration's budget increases are "wasteful."
    * **Concern:** This could harm vulnerable populations in developing countries who rely on U.S. foreign aid for essential services like health care, education, and disaster relief.
* **Empowering Faith-Based Organizations:** Primorac advocates for increasing funding to faith-based organizations, arguing that they are more effective than secular organizations in providing development assistance.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to discrimination against beneficiaries who do not share the religious beliefs of the funded organizations and undermine the principle of separation of church and state.

**Summary:**

Chapter 9 outlines a plan to transform USAID into an agency that prioritizes conservative values and American interests over the needs of developing countries. The chapter's recommendations would likely lead to a reduction in foreign aid, a shift in funding priorities toward faith-based organizations, and a more confrontational approach to development assistance, particularly with respect to China. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for USAID to be used as a tool for promoting a partisan agenda and for undermining efforts to address global challenges like poverty, disease, and climate change.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Harm to Vulnerable Populations:** The proposed cuts to foreign aid and the shift in funding priorities could harm vulnerable populations in developing countries who rely on U.S. assistance for essential services.
* **Erosion of Women's Rights:** The elimination of programs related to abortion and gender equality could undermine efforts to promote women's rights and reproductive health in developing countries.
* **Exacerbating Climate Change:** The rejection of climate change initiatives could undermine efforts to address this global challenge and harm vulnerable communities that are already experiencing the effects of climate change.
* **Promoting Religious Discrimination:** The emphasis on funding faith-based organizations could lead to discrimination against beneficiaries who do not share the religious beliefs of those organizations.
* **Undermining American Leadership:** The chapter's confrontational tone and its focus on countering China could undermine America's global leadership and damage its relationships with developing countries.

This chapter, along with Chapters 4, 6, and 8, reveals a clear pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to use the power of the federal government to advance a conservative agenda, even if it means sacrificing the interests of vulnerable populations, undermining democratic norms, and eroding America's global standing. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the lives of millions of people around the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the future direction of U.S. foreign policy and development assistance.
