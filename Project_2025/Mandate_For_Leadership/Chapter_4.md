## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 4 Breakdown

**[Chapter 4: Department of Defense](../../Documents/Project_2025_Chapters/Chapter_4.pdf)**

**Author:** Christopher Miller, Former Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Defense (DOD), the largest and most expensive part of the federal government. Miller argues that the DOD is a "deeply troubled institution" that has been weakened by a focus on "leftist politics" and the "Biden Administrationâ€™s profoundly unserious equity agenda and vaccine mandates." He outlines a plan to restore the DOD's focus on "warfighting" and to prepare the nation for "great-power competition," particularly with China.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **China as the Primary Threat:** Miller identifies China as the "most significant danger" to American security and calls for a "denial defense" strategy to counter Chinese expansionism in Asia.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a dangerous escalation of tensions with China and a costly arms race in the Pacific.
* **Increased Military Spending:** Miller argues that the U.S. needs to spend more on defense to counter the threats posed by China, Russia, and other adversaries.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to cuts in social programs and other vital domestic spending priorities.
* **Nuclear Modernization and Expansion:** Miller calls for modernizing and expanding the U.S. nuclear arsenal to deter both Russia and China.
    * **Concern:** This could increase the risk of nuclear war and undermine efforts to reduce nuclear proliferation.
* **Missile Defense:** Miller advocates for treating missile defense as a "top priority" and for abandoning the existing policy of not defending the homeland against Russian and Chinese ballistic missiles.
    * **Concern:** This could destabilize the strategic balance and provoke a dangerous response from Russia and China.
* **"Woke" Culture:** Miller echoes Vought's criticism of the "woke" culture within the military and calls for eliminating programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, critical race theory, and transgender service.
    * **Concern:** This suggests a disregard for the importance of diversity and inclusion in the military and a willingness to discriminate against transgender service members.
* **Military as a Tool for Social Change:** Miller argues against using the military as a "test bed for social evolution," suggesting a more traditional and less inclusive view of the military's role in society.
    * **Concern:** This could discourage qualified individuals from diverse backgrounds from serving in the military and undermine efforts to create a more inclusive and representative armed forces.

**Summary:**

Chapter 4 outlines a plan to significantly reorient the Department of Defense toward a more aggressive and confrontational posture, particularly with respect to China. Miller's recommendations would likely lead to increased military spending, a renewed focus on nuclear weapons, and a rollback of efforts to promote diversity and inclusion within the military. These proposals could have a destabilizing effect on international relations and undermine America's moral standing in the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for unnecessary conflict and a militarization of American foreign policy.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Risk of War:** The chapter's hawkish tone and emphasis on military strength could increase the risk of conflict with China, Russia, or other adversaries.
* **Military Industrial Complex:** The call for increased military spending could benefit defense contractors and further entrench the influence of the military-industrial complex in American politics.
* **Erosion of American Values:** The chapter's dismissal of diversity, equity, and inclusion and its criticism of "woke" culture suggest a retreat from American values of equality and opportunity.
* **Diminished Diplomatic Efforts:** The chapter's focus on military strength could undermine diplomatic efforts to resolve international conflicts peacefully.

This chapter, perhaps more than any other, highlights the stark differences in worldview between conservatives and liberals on issues of national security and foreign policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a profound impact on the future of America's role in the world, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a more militaristic and less diplomatic approach to international relations.
