## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 7 Breakdown

**Chapter 7: Intelligence Community**

**Author:** Dustin J. Carmack, Former Chief of Staff for the Director of National Intelligence

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the network of 18 agencies responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to policymakers. Carmack argues that the IC is too focused on "yesterday's threats and methodologies" and suffers from "hesitancy, groupthink, and an overly cautious approach." He outlines a plan to reform the IC, making it more responsive to the President's priorities and better equipped to counter emerging threats, particularly from China.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Politicization of Intelligence:** Carmack emphasizes the need for the IC to be "devoid of all political motivations" but also calls for aligning the IC with the President's priorities.
    * **Concern:** This could create a tension between the IC's duty to provide objective, non-partisan intelligence and the pressure to conform to the President's political agenda.
* **Strengthening the DNI:** Carmack argues for strengthening the authority of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to lead and direct the IC, including giving the DNI greater budget and personnel control.
    * **Concern:** This could concentrate too much power in the hands of a single individual, potentially leading to abuses of power and a less independent IC.
* **Focus on China:** Carmack identifies China as a major strategic threat and calls for refocusing the IC's resources and priorities to counter Chinese espionage and technological advancements. (Page 250)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to an overemphasis on China at the expense of other important threats and a potential for exaggerating the Chinese threat to justify increased intelligence spending and more intrusive surveillance.
* **Expanding Surveillance Powers:** Carmack advocates for amending Executive Order 12333 to expand the IC's surveillance powers, particularly in cyberspace.
    * **Concern:** This could erode privacy protections and civil liberties, potentially leading to government overreach and a chilling effect on free speech.
* **Revoking Security Clearances:** Carmack recommends revoking the security clearances of former intelligence officials who criticize the current Administration or disclose classified information without authorization.
    * **Concern:** This could be used to silence critics and whistleblowers, potentially covering up wrongdoing and discouraging accountability.
* **"Woke" Culture:** Carmack echoes Vought and Miller's criticism of the "woke" culture within the IC and calls for eliminating programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and "social justice" advocacy.
    * **Concern:** This suggests a disregard for the importance of diversity and inclusion in the intelligence workforce and a potential for discrimination against employees based on their political or social views.

**Summary:**

Chapter 7 outlines a plan to reform the Intelligence Community, making it more responsive to the President's priorities and more aggressive in countering perceived threats, particularly from China. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a more politicized and less independent IC, with expanded surveillance powers and a weaker commitment to protecting civil liberties. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for abuses of power and a further erosion of privacy and freedom.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Increased Surveillance:** The proposals to expand surveillance powers, particularly in cyberspace, could lead to increased government monitoring of citizens' online activities, potentially chilling free speech and eroding privacy.
* **Politicized Intelligence:** The emphasis on aligning the IC with the President's priorities could lead to intelligence being used to support the Administration's political agenda rather than providing objective, non-partisan analysis.
* **Targeting of Dissent:** The recommendation to revoke security clearances of former officials who criticize the Administration could be used to silence dissent and discourage whistleblowing.
* **Erosion of Civil Liberties:** The chapter's focus on national security and its criticism of "woke" culture suggest a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties in the name of fighting terrorism and countering foreign adversaries.

This chapter, along with Chapters 4 and 6, paints a picture of a future conservative administration that is more focused on national security, more willing to use the power of the government to achieve its goals, and less concerned about protecting civil liberties and democratic norms. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the balance of power between the executive branch and other branches of government, as well as on the rights and freedoms of American citizens.
