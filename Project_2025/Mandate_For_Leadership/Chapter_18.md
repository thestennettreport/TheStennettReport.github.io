## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 18 Breakdown

**[Chapter 18: Department of Labor and Related Agencies](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_18.pdf)**

**Author:** Jonathan Berry, Former Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy at the U.S. Department of Labor

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Labor (DOL) and related agencies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Berry argues that the Biden Administration has pursued a radical "left-wing social-engineering agenda" that undermines American workers and families. He outlines a conservative vision for labor policy that prioritizes "family-supporting jobs," worker independence, and a reduced role for government in labor markets.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Restoring the "Family-Supporting Job":** Berry emphasizes the need to restore the "family-supporting job" as the centerpiece of the American economy, suggesting that current labor policies are undermining families.
    * **Concern:** This rhetoric could be used to justify policies that weaken worker protections, reduce wages, and make it more difficult for families to make ends meet.
* **Reversing the DEI Revolution:** Berry criticizes the "DEI revolution" in labor policy, arguing that it has led to discrimination against conservative and religious viewpoints and has imposed burdensome regulations on businesses. He calls for eliminating DEI initiatives, restricting the application of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, and refocusing enforcement of sex discrimination laws on the "biological binary meaning of 'sex.'"
    * **Concern:** This would undermine efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace and could lead to discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and other marginalized groups.
* **Promoting Pro-Life Measures:** Berry advocates for "pro-life workplace accommodations for mothers," including requiring employers to provide equal or greater benefits for pregnancy and adoption as they do for abortion. He also calls for clarifying that ERISA does not preempt state laws restricting abortion.
    * **Concern:** This would impose a conservative religious agenda on businesses and could restrict access to reproductive health care for women.
* **Protecting Religious Employers:** Berry calls for providing "robust protections for religious employers," arguing that they should be free to run their businesses according to their religious beliefs, even if those beliefs conflict with anti-discrimination laws.
    * **Concern:** This could allow religious employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals and other groups based on their religious beliefs.
* **Expanding Independent Contractor Status:** Berry advocates for protecting "flexible work options and worker independence," including making it easier for businesses to classify workers as independent contractors.
    * **Concern:** This could erode worker protections and benefits, making it easier for businesses to exploit workers and avoid paying for unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, and other benefits.
* **Weakening Unions:** Berry supports reforms that would weaken unions, including the Teamwork for Employees and Managers (TEAM) Act, which would allow for the creation of non-union "employee involvement organizations." He also calls for increasing union transparency and restricting the scope of "protected concerted activity."
    * **Concern:** This would undermine the ability of workers to organize and bargain collectively for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.

**Summary:**

Chapter 18 outlines a conservative vision for labor policy that prioritizes a traditional view of the family, religious freedom, and a reduced role for government in regulating the workplace. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a weakening of worker protections, a decline in union membership, and increased discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and other marginalized groups. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less worker-friendly labor market under a future conservative administration.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Erosion of Worker Protections:** The proposals to expand independent contractor status, weaken unions, and roll back DEI initiatives could erode worker protections, leading to lower wages, fewer benefits, and worse working conditions.
* **Increased Discrimination:** The proposals to restrict the application of *Bostock v. Clayton County* and to protect religious employers could lead to increased discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and other groups.
* **Imposition of a Conservative Agenda:** The proposals to promote pro-life measures and protect religious employers suggest a desire to impose a conservative religious agenda on businesses and workers.
* **Weakening of the Social Safety Net:** The proposals to reform unemployment insurance and reduce the role of government in workforce development could weaken the social safety net and make it more difficult for workers to find and keep good jobs.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reveals a consistent pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to reduce the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and protecting workers' rights. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of American workers and their families, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less just and less equitable society under a future conservative administration.
