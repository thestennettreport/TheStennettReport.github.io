## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 26 Breakdown

**[Chapter 26: Trade](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_26.pdf)**

**Authors:** Peter Navarro (The Case for Fair Trade) and Kent Lassman (The Case for Free Trade)

**Introduction:**

This chapter presents two opposing viewpoints on U.S. trade policy. Peter Navarro argues for a "fair trade" approach that prioritizes protecting American workers and businesses from unfair foreign competition, particularly from China. Kent Lassman advocates for a "free trade" approach that emphasizes lowering trade barriers and promoting free markets, arguing that this is the best way to boost economic growth and strengthen American leadership in the global economy.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats (Navarro's Argument):**

* **Trade Deficits Matter:** Navarro argues that trade deficits are a sign of economic weakness and that they harm American workers and businesses. He claims that the U.S. is the "globeâ€™s biggest trade loser" due to unfair trade practices by other countries, particularly China.
    * **Concern:** This view is disputed by many economists, who argue that trade deficits are not necessarily a sign of economic weakness and that they can be beneficial in some cases. Focusing on reducing trade deficits could lead to protectionist policies that harm consumers and businesses.
* **Reciprocal Trade:** Navarro advocates for a "reciprocal trade" approach, where the U.S. would impose tariffs or other trade barriers on countries that do not offer reciprocal access to their markets. He supports the U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act, which would give the President the authority to raise tariffs to match those of other countries.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to trade wars and retaliatory tariffs, harming American businesses and consumers. It could also undermine the rules-based international trading system and weaken America's global leadership.
* **Decoupling from China:** Navarro calls for "decoupling" the U.S. economy from China's, arguing that China's economic aggression poses a threat to American national security. He advocates for a range of policies to reduce U.S. dependence on China, including tariffs, investment restrictions, and sanctions.
    * **Concern:** Decoupling from China would be costly and disruptive for American businesses and consumers. It could also exacerbate tensions with China and lead to a more divided and less stable global economy.
* **Protecting American Manufacturing:** Navarro argues that trade policy should be used to protect American manufacturing jobs and to rebuild the U.S. industrial base.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to protectionist policies that raise prices for consumers and make American businesses less competitive. It could also stifle innovation and slow economic growth.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats (Lassman's Argument):**

* **Free Trade and Free Markets:** Lassman argues that free trade and free markets are the best way to promote economic growth, create jobs, and raise living standards. He criticizes protectionist policies, such as tariffs, as being harmful to consumers and businesses.
    * **Concern:** This view is generally shared by Democrats, but Lassman's emphasis on free markets could also be seen as a justification for deregulation and a weakening of worker protections.
* **Trade Creates Peace:** Lassman argues that trade promotes peace and stability by fostering economic interdependence between countries. He believes that engaging with China through trade is the best way to encourage political and economic reforms. (Page 839)
    * **Concern:** While trade can promote peace, it is not a guarantee of peace, and it can also be used by authoritarian regimes to advance their own interests.
* **American Economic Strength:** Lassman argues that the U.S. economy is strong and that American manufacturing is at an all-time high. He believes that the U.S. should focus on its strengths, such as innovation and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to protect declining industries.
    * **Concern:** While the U.S. economy is generally strong, there are concerns about income inequality and the decline of manufacturing jobs in certain regions.
* **Limited Government:** Lassman advocates for a limited role for government in trade policy, arguing that the government should focus on reducing trade barriers and promoting free markets rather than trying to pick winners and losers.
    * **Concern:** This could be seen as a justification for a hands-off approach to trade policy that could allow unfair trade practices to go unchecked.

**Summary:**

Chapter 26 presents two contrasting views on U.S. trade policy, reflecting the ongoing debate between "fair trade" and "free trade" advocates. Navarro's argument for a more protectionist approach is likely to resonate with some Democrats who are concerned about the loss of manufacturing jobs and the impact of unfair trade practices on American workers. However, Lassman's argument for a more free market-oriented approach is more aligned with the traditional Democratic view of trade policy.

**Why This Chapter Might Be of Interest to Democrats:**

* **Debate on Trade Policy:** The chapter provides a useful overview of the arguments for and against different approaches to trade policy, highlighting the complexities of this issue.
* **Focus on China:** The chapter acknowledges the challenge posed by China's economic aggression and explores different policy options for addressing it.
* **Impact on American Workers:** The chapter raises concerns about the impact of trade on American workers, particularly those in manufacturing, and explores ways to mitigate those impacts.
* **Role of Government:** The chapter debates the appropriate role of government in trade policy, highlighting the tension between promoting free markets and protecting American interests.

This chapter, like the chapter on the Export-Import Bank, demonstrates the lack of consensus within the conservative movement on trade policy. The opposing viewpoints presented by Navarro and Lassman reflect the broader debate within the Republican Party about the role of government in the economy and the best way to promote American prosperity. Democrats are likely to find Lassman's arguments more persuasive and may see this chapter as an opportunity to build bipartisan support for a more free trade-oriented approach. However, they may also be concerned about the potential for a future conservative administration to adopt a more protectionist approach, as advocated by Navarro.
