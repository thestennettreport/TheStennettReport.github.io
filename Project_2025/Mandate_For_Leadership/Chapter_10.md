## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 10 Breakdown

**[Chapter 10: Department of Agriculture](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_10.pdf)**

**Author:** Daren Bakst, Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the agency responsible for overseeing American agriculture and food policy. Bakst argues that the Biden Administration is seeking to "transform the food system" through a centralized plan that prioritizes climate change and "equity" over efficient food production. He outlines a conservative vision for the USDA that emphasizes limited government intervention, sound science, and individual freedom.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Defending American Agriculture:** Bakst calls for "defending American agriculture" against the Biden Administration's efforts to "transform the food system," arguing that the government should not interfere with farmers' ability to produce food efficiently and affordably.
    * **Concern:** This rhetoric could be used to justify a rollback of regulations that protect consumers, workers, and the environment, potentially leading to unsafe food, unfair labor practices, and environmental degradation.
* **Eliminating Farm Subsidies:** Bakst advocates for eliminating or significantly reforming farm subsidies, arguing that they distort markets, discourage innovation, and harm taxpayers.
    * **Concern:** This could harm small farmers who rely on subsidies to stay afloat and make American agriculture less competitive in the global market.
* **Moving Food and Nutrition Programs:** Bakst recommends moving all USDA food and nutrition programs, including SNAP (food stamps) and WIC, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a less effective and less compassionate approach to addressing hunger and food insecurity, potentially making it more difficult for low-income families to access essential food assistance.
* **Reforming SNAP:** Bakst calls for reforming SNAP by re-implementing work requirements, reforming broad-based categorical eligibility, re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan, and eliminating the "heat-and-eat" loophole.
    * **Concern:** These proposals would likely make it more difficult for low-income families to qualify for and receive SNAP benefits, potentially increasing hunger and food insecurity.
* **Returning School Meals to "Original Intent":** Bakst argues that federal school meal programs have strayed from their original intent of providing food to low-income children and calls for eliminating the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows schools with high concentrations of poverty to offer free meals to all students.
    * **Concern:** This would likely reduce access to school meals for children from low-income families, potentially harming their health and academic performance.
* **Reforming Conservation Programs:** Bakst advocates for eliminating the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which pays farmers to take environmentally sensitive land out of production, and for reforming conservation easements to make them less restrictive.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to increased environmental degradation and a loss of valuable habitat for wildlife.

**Summary:**

Chapter 10 outlines a conservative vision for the USDA that prioritizes deregulation, reduced government spending, and a shift in focus away from addressing social problems like hunger and food insecurity. The chapter's recommendations could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly low-income families and farmers, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased hunger, environmental degradation, and a less competitive agricultural sector.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Increased Hunger and Food Insecurity:** The proposals to cut farm subsidies, move food and nutrition programs to HHS, and reform SNAP could lead to increased hunger and food insecurity, particularly among low-income families.
* **Weakening Environmental Protections:** The proposals to eliminate the CRP and reform conservation easements could lead to increased environmental degradation and a loss of valuable habitat for wildlife.
* **Harming Small Farmers:** The elimination of farm subsidies could harm small farmers who rely on those subsidies to stay afloat.
* **Reduced Access to School Meals:** The elimination of the CEP could reduce access to school meals for children from low-income families.

This chapter, along with Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, demonstrates a consistent pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to shrink the role of the federal government in addressing social and economic problems, even if it means harming vulnerable populations and undermining efforts to protect the environment and promote equality. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less just and less equitable society under a future conservative administration.
