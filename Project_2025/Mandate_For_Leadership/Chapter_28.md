## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 28 Breakdown

**Chapter 28: Federal Communications Commission**

**Author:** Brendan Carr, Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), outlining a conservative vision for the agency that prioritizes reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, unleashing economic prosperity, and ensuring accountability and good governance. Carr argues that the FCC has a crucial role to play in protecting individual liberty, securing communications networks, and fostering innovation and competition.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Reining in Big Tech:** Carr emphasizes the need to address the "threats to individual liberty" posed by Big Tech companies, particularly their power to censor speech and control information online. He advocates for the FCC to interpret Section 230 more narrowly, impose transparency rules on Big Tech, and support legislation that would limit their immunity from liability for content moderation decisions.
    * **Concern:** While concerns about Big Tech's power are legitimate, Democrats may worry that Carr's proposals could be used to stifle free speech online and to give the government more control over the internet. They may also be concerned that a narrower interpretation of Section 230 could lead to increased censorship and a chilling effect on online expression.
* **Promoting National Security:** Carr highlights the FCC's role in protecting national security, particularly from threats posed by China. He advocates for expanding the FCC's Covered List of prohibited equipment and services, closing loopholes that allow Chinese companies to operate in the U.S. without FCC oversight, and fully funding the "rip and replace" program to remove insecure equipment from U.S. networks.
    * **Concern:** While national security is a paramount concern, Democrats may worry that Carr's proposals could lead to a more confrontational approach to China and could be used to justify a broader crackdown on Chinese businesses and individuals in the U.S.
* **Unleashing Economic Prosperity:** Carr advocates for a pro-growth agenda that promotes broadband connectivity, frees up spectrum for wireless services, modernizes infrastructure rules, and advances America's space leadership.
    * **Concern:** Democrats may agree with the need to promote broadband connectivity and innovation, but they may be concerned that Carr's emphasis on deregulation and a reduced role for government could lead to a widening of the digital divide and a decrease in consumer protections.
* **Ensuring Accountability and Good Governance:** Carr calls for greater accountability and transparency at the FCC, including ending wasteful broadband spending policies, adopting a national coordinating strategy for broadband initiatives, and eliminating outdated regulations.
    * **Concern:** While accountability and transparency are important, Democrats may worry that Carr's proposals could be used to justify cuts to important FCC programs and to weaken the agency's ability to regulate the communications industry.

**Summary:**

Chapter 28 outlines a conservative vision for the FCC that prioritizes reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, and fostering a more market-oriented approach to communications policy. While some of Carr's proposals, such as those related to broadband connectivity and infrastructure modernization, may find bipartisan support, others, such as those related to Section 230 and China, are likely to be more controversial and could raise concerns among Democrats about the potential for government overreach, censorship, and discrimination.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Erosion of Net Neutrality:** Carr's support for a more market-oriented approach to communications policy could lead to a rollback of net neutrality rules, potentially allowing internet service providers to prioritize certain content and discriminate against others.
* **Increased Censorship:** A narrower interpretation of Section 230 could lead to increased censorship by online platforms, as they may be more likely to remove content to avoid liability.
* **Weakening of Consumer Protections:** The emphasis on deregulation and a reduced role for government could lead to a weakening of consumer protections in the communications industry, potentially resulting in higher prices, fewer choices, and worse service for consumers.
* **Anti-China Bias:** The chapter's focus on countering China's influence could lead to discriminatory policies against Chinese businesses and individuals in the U.S. and could undermine efforts to build a constructive relationship with China.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, highlights the conservative agenda to reduce the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and to promote a more individualistic and less equitable approach to social policy. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the internet, the communications industry, and U.S.-China relations, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less free, less fair, and less stable world under a future conservative administration.
