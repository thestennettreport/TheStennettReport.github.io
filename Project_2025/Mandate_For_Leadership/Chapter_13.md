## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 13 Breakdown

**Chapter 13: Environmental Protection Agency**

**Author:** Mandy M. Gunasekara, Principal at Section VII Strategies and Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), arguing that it has become a "coercive" agency captured by "embedded activists" pursuing a "global, climate-themed agenda." Gunasekara advocates for a more limited role for the EPA, emphasizing state leadership, cooperative federalism, and a focus on tangible environmental improvements rather than "costly, job-killing regulations."

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **"Back to Basics":** Gunasekara calls for a "back to basics" approach to environmental protection, arguing that the EPA should focus on its core mission of protecting public health and the environment in cooperation with states, rather than pursuing a "global, climate-themed agenda."
    * **Concern:** This rhetoric could be used to justify a rollback of environmental regulations and a weakening of the EPA's ability to address climate change and other pressing environmental challenges.
* **State Leadership:** Gunasekara emphasizes the importance of state leadership in environmental protection, arguing that the EPA should take a more supportive role and defer to states whenever possible.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a patchwork of inconsistent environmental regulations across the country, with some states failing to adequately protect public health and the environment.
* **Cooperative Federalism:** Gunasekara advocates for a "cooperative federalism" approach, arguing that the EPA should work collaboratively with states rather than imposing top-down regulations.
    * **Concern:** This could weaken the EPA's ability to enforce national environmental standards and could allow states to weaken environmental protections to attract businesses.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Gunasekara calls for a more rigorous and transparent use of cost-benefit analysis in environmental regulation, arguing that the EPA should consider the economic costs of its actions and avoid "costly, job-killing regulations."
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a downplaying of the benefits of environmental protection and could result in weaker regulations that fail to adequately protect public health and the environment.
* **"Transparent Science":** Gunasekara advocates for "transparent science and regulatory analysis," arguing that the EPA should make public all scientific studies and analyses that support its decision-making.
    * **Concern:** This could be used to cherry-pick data and downplay the scientific consensus on climate change and other environmental issues.
* **Reining in the EPA:** Gunasekara outlines a plan to "streamline" and "restructure" the EPA, including eliminating or consolidating various offices and programs.
    * **Concern:** This could weaken the EPA's ability to carry out its mission and could lead to a less effective and less responsive agency.

**Summary:**

Chapter 13 outlines a conservative vision for the EPA that prioritizes state leadership, cooperative federalism, and a reduced role for the federal government in environmental protection. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a weakening of environmental regulations, a rollback of efforts to address climate change, and a less effective and less accountable EPA. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased pollution, environmental degradation, and a disregard for the scientific consensus on climate change.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Weakening Environmental Protections:** The emphasis on state leadership, cooperative federalism, and cost-benefit analysis could lead to a weakening of national environmental standards and allow states to roll back protections to attract businesses.
* **Ignoring Climate Change:** The chapter's focus on "tangible environmental improvements" and its criticism of a "global, climate-themed agenda" suggest a downplaying of the urgency of addressing climate change.
* **Undermining the EPA:** The proposals to streamline and restructure the EPA could weaken the agency's ability to carry out its mission and protect public health and the environment.
* **Disregarding Science:** The call for "transparent science" could be used to cherry-pick data and undermine the scientific consensus on climate change and other environmental issues.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reinforces the pattern of "Project 2025" to limit the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and protecting the environment. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the health of our planet and the well-being of American citizens, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less healthy and less sustainable environment under a future conservative administration.
