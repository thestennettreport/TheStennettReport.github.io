title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 13 - Environmental Protection Agency 
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Environmental Protection Agency](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_13.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_13_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Mandy M. Gunasekara, Principal at Section VII Strategies and Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation

Chapter 13 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), arguing that it has become a "coercive" agency captured by "embedded activists" pursuing a "global, climate-themed agenda." Gunasekara, a former EPA official during the Trump administration and a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, advocates for a drastically reduced role for the EPA, emphasizing state leadership, cooperative federalism, and a focus on tangible environmental improvements rather than "costly, job-killing regulations."

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a fundamental shift in environmental policy, away from federal leadership and towards a more decentralized and industry-friendly approach. Gunasekara's recommendations could lead to a weakening of environmental regulations, a rollback of efforts to address climate change, and a less effective and less accountable EPA. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased pollution, environmental degradation, and a disregard for the scientific consensus on climate change.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **"Back to Basics":** Gunasekara calls for a "back to basics" approach to environmental protection, arguing that the EPA should focus on its core mission of protecting public health and the environment in cooperation with states, rather than pursuing a "global, climate-themed agenda." This rhetoric suggests a desire to narrow the EPA's scope and to limit its ability to address issues like climate change that conservatives view as outside its core mandate.
* **State Leadership:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of state leadership in environmental protection, arguing that the EPA should take a more supportive role and defer to states whenever possible. This reflects a broader conservative preference for decentralization and a belief that states are better equipped to address local environmental issues.
* **Cooperative Federalism:** Gunasekara advocates for a "cooperative federalism" approach, arguing that the EPA should work collaboratively with states rather than imposing top-down regulations. This could weaken the EPA's ability to enforce national environmental standards and could allow states to weaken environmental protections to attract businesses.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** The chapter calls for a more rigorous and transparent use of cost-benefit analysis in environmental regulation, arguing that the EPA should consider the economic costs of its actions and avoid "costly, job-killing regulations." This could lead to a downplaying of the benefits of environmental protection and could result in weaker regulations that fail to adequately protect public health and the environment.
* **"Sound Science":** Gunasekara advocates for "sound science and regulatory analysis," arguing that the EPA should base its decisions on "sound science" and avoid relying on "junk science" or "political agendas." This rhetoric could be used to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change and other environmental issues and to justify a rollback of regulations based on industry-funded research.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

* **Challenge Climate Science:**  Promote skepticism towards climate change and undermine the scientific consensus on the issue.

### 6. CROSS-REFERENCES

* **Agenda 47:**  The chapter's emphasis on deregulation, state leadership, and skepticism towards climate change aligns with the broader goals outlined in Trump's Agenda 47.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 12](./chapter_12.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of Energy, complements Chapter 13 by advocating for increased fossil fuel production and a reduction in support for renewable energy.
* **[Project 2025, Chapter 16](./chapter_16.md):**  This chapter, focusing on the Department of the Interior, supports Chapter 13 by calling for opening up public lands to energy development and for weakening protections for endangered species.

### 7. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

* **Increased Pollution:**  Weakening environmental regulations could lead to an increase in air and water pollution, harming public health, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color.
* **Exacerbated Climate Change:**  Rolling back climate regulations and promoting fossil fuels could accelerate climate change, leading to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and other harmful consequences.
* **Environmental Degradation:**  Weakening protections for endangered species and their habitats could lead to a loss of biodiversity and damage to ecosystems.
* **Weakening of Public Health Protections:**  A less effective EPA could result in weaker enforcement of public health protections, potentially increasing the risk of exposure to hazardous substances and other environmental hazards.
* **Damage to U.S. Global Standing:**  Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and rejecting climate action could damage America's reputation in the world and undermine its leadership on global issues.

### 8. CRITICISMS & COUNTERARGUMENTS

* **Disregard for Science:**  Critics might argue that the chapter's emphasis on "sound science" is a thinly veiled attempt to disregard the scientific consensus on climate change and other environmental issues.
* **Prioritizing Profits over People:**  Opponents might argue that the chapter's focus on deregulation and cost-benefit analysis would prioritize the profits of corporations over the health and well-being of communities and the environment.
* **Weakening Federal Protections:**  Critics might argue that shifting responsibility for environmental protection to states would lead to a patchwork of inconsistent regulations and could allow some states to weaken protections to attract businesses.
* **Environmental Justice Concerns:**  Opponents might argue that the chapter's recommendations would disproportionately harm low-income communities and communities of color, which are often located near polluting industries and are more vulnerable to environmental hazards.

### 9. KEY QUOTES

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 13 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for the EPA that prioritizes state leadership, cooperative federalism, and a reduced role for the federal government in environmental protection. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a weakening of environmental regulations, a rollback of efforts to address climate change, and a less effective and less accountable EPA. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased pollution, environmental degradation, and a disregard for the scientific consensus on climate change.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reinforces the pattern of "Project 2025" to limit the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and protecting the environment. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the health of our planet and the well-being of American citizens, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less healthy and less sustainable environment under a future conservative administration.
