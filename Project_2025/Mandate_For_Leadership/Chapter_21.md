## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 21 Breakdown

**Chapter 21: Department of Commerce**

**Author:** Thomas F. Gilman, Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Administration

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Commerce, arguing that it has become dominated by career staff who are resistant to implementing conservative policies. Gilman emphasizes the need for strong political leadership to reorient the department towards promoting economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness, particularly in the face of challenges from China. He outlines a plan to streamline the department, strengthen its enforcement capabilities, and make it more responsive to the needs of American businesses.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Strong Political Control:** Gilman stresses the need for strong political leadership at the Department of Commerce, arguing that career staff have too much influence and are resistant to change. (Page 696)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a politicization of the department and a disregard for the expertise and experience of career civil servants.
* **Countering China:** Gilman identifies China as a major economic threat and calls for the department to play a more active role in countering Chinese "malign influence," including through trade enforcement and export controls.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a more confrontational and less cooperative approach to economic relations with China, potentially harming American businesses and consumers.
* **Streamlining and Consolidating Agencies:** Gilman suggests that the department could be streamlined by consolidating or eliminating certain agencies and programs, including the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). (Page 696)
    * **Concern:** This could weaken the department's ability to promote economic development, protect the environment, and conduct important scientific research.
* **Strengthening Enforcement:** Gilman calls for strengthening the department's enforcement capabilities, particularly in the areas of trade and export controls.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a more aggressive and less nuanced approach to enforcement, potentially harming American businesses that are engaged in legitimate trade and investment activities.
* **Deregulation and Business-Friendly Policies:** Gilman advocates for a more business-friendly approach to regulation, suggesting that the department should focus on reducing the regulatory burden on businesses.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a weakening of consumer protections, environmental regulations, and other safeguards that are designed to protect the public interest.

**Specific Agency Recommendations & Concerns:**

* **International Trade Administration (ITA):** Gilman calls for the ITA to focus on countering China's "malign influence," enforcing trade agreements, and securing access to critical supply chains.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a more protectionist trade policy that harms American consumers and businesses that rely on imports.
* **Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS):** Gilman advocates for strengthening export controls to prevent the transfer of sensitive technologies to China and other adversaries.
    * **Concern:** This could harm American businesses that export high-tech products and could stifle innovation.
* **Census Bureau:** Gilman calls for a review of the Census Bureau's data collection methods and for adding a citizenship question to the 2030 Census.
    * **Concern:** This could be used to suppress minority participation in the Census and could lead to an undercount of certain populations, potentially affecting political representation and the allocation of federal funds.

**Summary:**

Chapter 21 outlines a conservative vision for the Department of Commerce that prioritizes strong political control, a confrontational approach to China, deregulation, and a focus on promoting American business interests. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a more politicized and less effective department, with a weaker commitment to protecting consumers, the environment, and the integrity of the Census. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for abuses of power, a decline in the quality of government services, and a less equitable and less sustainable economy.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Politicization of the Department:** The emphasis on strong political control and the replacement of career staff with political appointees could lead to a politicization of the department and a disregard for expertise and experience.
* **Trade Wars with China:** The focus on countering China's "malign influence" could lead to a trade war that harms American businesses and consumers.
* **Weakening of Environmental Protections:** The proposals to streamline and consolidate agencies, including NOAA, could weaken environmental protections and undermine efforts to address climate change.
* **Undermining the Census:** The call for adding a citizenship question to the Census and for reviewing data collection methods could be used to suppress minority participation and could lead to an inaccurate count, potentially affecting political representation and the allocation of federal funds.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, reinforces the pattern of "Project 2025" to reduce the role of the federal government in regulating the economy, protecting the environment, and ensuring fair and accurate data collection. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the competitiveness of the U.S. economy, the health of our planet, and the fairness of our democracy, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less sustainable future under a future conservative administration.
