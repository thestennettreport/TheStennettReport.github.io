title: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 6 - Department of State
---

### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of State](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_6.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_6_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:**  Kiron K. Skinner, Former Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State

Chapter 6 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of State, the agency responsible for conducting American diplomacy and representing the U.S. abroad. Authored by Kiron K. Skinner, a former Director of Policy Planning at the State Department under President Trump, the chapter argues that the department is plagued by a "left-wing" workforce resistant to conservative policies and operates with a sense of "independence" from the President. Skinner outlines a plan to "reforge" the department into a "lean and functional diplomatic machine" that serves the President's agenda.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a radical transformation of the State Department, shifting it from a career-driven institution focused on diplomacy and multilateralism to a more ideologically driven and less diplomatic agency that prioritizes the President's agenda. These proposals could have a destabilizing effect on international relations and undermine America's global leadership, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a more confrontational and less cooperative approach to foreign policy.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Political Control:** Skinner emphasizes the need for strong political leadership at the State Department and for staffing key positions with individuals who are aligned with the President's ideology. This suggests a desire to politicize the foreign service and to prioritize loyalty over expertise and experience.
* **Confrontational Posture:** The chapter advocates for a more confrontational approach to foreign policy, particularly with respect to China and Russia, suggesting a preference for using American power to assert dominance rather than engaging in diplomacy and cooperation.
* **Rejection of Multilateralism:** Skinner criticizes international organizations and agreements that she believes erode U.S. sovereignty and calls for withdrawing from or defunding those organizations. This reflects a broader conservative skepticism towards multilateralism and a preference for unilateral action.
* **Promotion of Conservative Social Values:** Skinner advocates for using U.S. foreign policy to promote conservative social values, such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. This could alienate allies and partners who do not share those values and could undermine America's moral standing in the world.
* **"America First" Foreign Policy:** The chapter reflects an "America First" approach to foreign policy, prioritizing the interests of the United States over global cooperation or humanitarian concerns.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: A Department in Need of Reform <sup>(198)</sup>**

* Skinner argues that the State Department is in need of "fundamental reform" to make it more responsive to the President's agenda and to address the challenges of the 21st century.
* She criticizes the department's "culture of resistance" to conservative policies and its "lack of accountability" to political leadership.
* **Quote:** "The State Department has become a bastion of liberalism, resistant to change and out of touch with the priorities of the American people."

**3.2 The Problem: A "Left-Wing" Workforce <sup>(199)</sup>**

* Skinner argues that the State Department is dominated by a "left-wing" workforce that is hostile to conservative policies and that operates with a sense of "independence" from the President.
* She criticizes the Foreign Service's "up-or-out" promotion system, arguing that it rewards conformity and discourages dissent.
* **Quote:** "The Foreign Service is a self-perpetuating elite that is more interested in protecting its own perks and privileges than in serving the interests of the American people."

**3.3 The Solution: Restoring Political Control <sup>(206)</sup>**

* Skinner outlines a plan to "reforge" the State Department by:
    * **Appointing Loyalists:**  Appointing individuals who are aligned with the President's ideology to key positions, including ambassadorships and assistant secretary positions.
    * **Bypassing Senate Confirmation:**  Placing political appointees in acting roles even before they are confirmed by the Senate, potentially circumventing the Senate's advice and consent role.
    * **Restructuring the Department:**  Streamlining the department's bureaucracy and eliminating or consolidating offices and programs that are not aligned with the President's priorities.
    * **Reforming the Foreign Service:**  Changing the Foreign Service's promotion system to reward performance and loyalty, rather than conformity.

**3.4 Foreign Policy Priorities <sup>(212)</sup>**

* Skinner outlines a number of foreign policy priorities for a conservative administration, including:
    * **Countering China:**  Taking a more confrontational approach to China, including through trade sanctions, military buildups, and diplomatic pressure.
    * **Confronting Russia:**  Challenging Russian aggression in Europe and elsewhere, while also seeking areas of cooperation.
    * **Promoting "Sovereign Mexico":**  Working with Mexico to address illegal immigration and drug trafficking, but also potentially intervening in Mexican affairs to restore "order."
    * **Rejecting Multilateralism:**  Withdrawing from or defunding international organizations and agreements that Skinner believes erode U.S. sovereignty.
    * **Promoting Conservative Social Values:**  Using U.S. foreign policy to promote conservative social values, such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.

**3.5 Conclusion: A "Lean and Functional Diplomatic Machine" <sup>(227)</sup>**

* Skinner concludes by arguing that her recommendations are necessary to transform the State Department into a "lean and functional diplomatic machine" that serves the President's agenda and advances American interests.
* She claims that these reforms will "restore America's global leadership" and "make the world a safer place."
