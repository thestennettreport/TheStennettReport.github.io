### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Executive Office of the President of the United States](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_2.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_2_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Russ Vought, Former Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)

Chapter 2 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" delves into the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the collection of agencies and offices directly supporting the President. Authored by Russ Vought, former Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Trump, the chapter emphasizes the EOP's critical role in advancing a conservative agenda and dismantling the "administrative state." 

Vought argues that the EOP must be used aggressively to "limit, control, and direct the executive branch," advocating for a significant shift in power dynamics within the government. He outlines specific recommendations for how a conservative President can leverage key EOP components, particularly the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to control the bureaucracy, roll back regulations, and implement conservative policy priorities.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Executive Power Maximization:** Vought emphasizes maximizing executive power to overcome bureaucratic resistance and implement the President's agenda, suggesting a willingness to challenge traditional norms and limitations on presidential authority.
* **Dismantling the Administrative State:** The chapter reflects a core conservative goal of reducing the size and scope of the federal government and curtailing the power of unelected bureaucrats.
* **"Personnel is Policy":**  Vought reiterates the conservative belief that staffing decisions are crucial for achieving policy goals, advocating for appointing loyal and ideologically aligned individuals to key positions within the EOP.
* **Aggressive Budgetary Control:** The chapter highlights the OMB's power to control agency spending and to use the budget process to advance the President's agenda, even if it means circumventing Congressional intent.
* **Regulatory Rollback:** Vought calls for a significant rollback of regulations, arguing that they stifle economic growth and individual liberty. He advocates for streamlining the regulatory process and limiting agency discretion.

**3.3 Apportionments and Spending Control <sup>(78)</sup>**

* Vought recommends that Program Associate Directors (PADs) at OMB personally sign apportionments, giving them greater control over agency spending.

**3.7 Conclusion <sup>(93)</sup>**

* Vought reiterates the importance of using the EOP aggressively to advance the President's agenda and to dismantle the "Administrative State."
