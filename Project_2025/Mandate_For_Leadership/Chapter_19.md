## Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 19 Breakdown

**Chapter 19: Department of Transportation**

**Author:** Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Director of the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment at The Heritage Foundation

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Department of Transportation (DOT), arguing that the Biden Administration's "anti-fossil-fuel climate agenda" is driving up transportation costs and reducing consumer choice. Furchtgott-Roth advocates for a more market-oriented approach to transportation policy, emphasizing affordability, abundance, safety, and a reduced role for government in transportation decisions.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Affordable and Abundant Transportation:** Furchtgott-Roth emphasizes the need for transportation that is "more abundant and affordable," arguing that the Biden Administration's policies are making transportation more expensive and less accessible. (Page 652)
    * **Concern:** This rhetoric could be used to justify cuts to public transportation funding and a weakening of environmental regulations, potentially harming low-income communities and exacerbating climate change.
    * **Quote:** "America needs transportation that is more abundant and affordable as well as dignified, accessible, and family friendly."
* **Reducing the DOT's Role:** Furchtgott-Roth argues that the DOT has become a "de facto grantmaking and lending organization" and that its role should be reduced to providing a "safety and regulatory framework." (Page 652)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a decrease in funding for transportation infrastructure projects, particularly those that benefit public transportation and alternative modes of transportation.
* **Privatization and User Fees:** Furchtgott-Roth advocates for greater reliance on privatization and user fees to fund transportation infrastructure, arguing that this would reduce the need for government spending and make transportation decisions more responsive to market forces. (Page 655)
    * **Concern:** This could lead to higher costs for consumers and could make transportation less accessible for low-income communities.
* **Rolling Back Fuel Economy Standards:** Furchtgott-Roth criticizes the Biden Administration's fuel economy standards for automobiles, arguing that they are too stringent and are forcing automakers to produce more expensive electric vehicles (EVs). (Page 659)
    * **Concern:** This would undermine efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, a major contributor to climate change.
* **Challenging California's Waiver:** Furchtgott-Roth calls for revoking California's waiver under the Clean Air Act, which allows the state to set its own stricter emissions standards for vehicles. (Page 662)
    * **Concern:** This would weaken California's ability to address air pollution and climate change and could set a precedent for the federal government to overrule other state environmental regulations.
* **Promoting Public-Private Partnerships (P3s):** Furchtgott-Roth advocates for greater use of P3s to finance transportation infrastructure projects, arguing that they can provide cost savings and efficiency. (Page 656)
    * **Concern:** P3s can be risky and can lead to higher costs for consumers in the long run. They can also prioritize profits over public good and can lack transparency and accountability.

**Summary:**

Chapter 19 outlines a conservative vision for transportation policy that prioritizes affordability, abundance, and a reduced role for government. The chapter's recommendations could lead to cuts in public transportation funding, a rollback of fuel economy standards, and a greater reliance on privatization and user fees. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for increased transportation costs, reduced access to transportation for low-income communities, and a weakening of efforts to address climate change.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Cuts to Public Transportation:** The emphasis on reducing the DOT's role and promoting privatization and user fees could lead to cuts in funding for public transportation, making it more difficult for people who rely on public transit to get to work, school, and other essential destinations.
* **Higher Transportation Costs:** The proposals to roll back fuel economy standards and increase reliance on user fees could lead to higher transportation costs for consumers, particularly those who cannot afford to purchase new, more fuel-efficient vehicles.
* **Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** The rollback of fuel economy standards and the lack of emphasis on promoting alternative modes of transportation could lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, exacerbating climate change.
* **Weakening of State Authority:** The call for revoking California's waiver could set a precedent for the federal government to overrule other state environmental regulations, potentially undermining states' ability to protect their citizens from pollution and other environmental harms.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, highlights the conservative agenda to reduce the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and providing public services. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the affordability, accessibility, and sustainability of America's transportation system, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less equitable and less environmentally friendly transportation future under a future conservative administration.
