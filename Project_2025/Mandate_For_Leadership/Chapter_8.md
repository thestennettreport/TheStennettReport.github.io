## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 8 Breakdown

**[Chapter 8: Media Agencies: U.S. Agency for Global Media](../../Documents/Project_2025_Chapters/Chapter_8.pdf)**

**Author:** Mora Namdar, Former Vice President of Legal, Compliance, and Risk at the U.S. Agency for Global Media

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the federal agency that oversees U.S. government-funded international broadcasting, including the Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia. Namdar argues that USAGM has strayed from its mission of promoting freedom and democracy and has become "mismanaged, disorganized, ineffective, and rife with waste and redundancy." She outlines a plan to reform USAGM, making it more accountable, efficient, and effective in countering adversarial propaganda and promoting American values.

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Propaganda Over Journalism:** Namdar criticizes USAGM for "parrot[ing] America’s adversaries’ propaganda and talking points" and calls for a renewed focus on presenting "the truth about America and American policy."
    * **Concern:** This suggests a desire to use USAGM as a tool for promoting American propaganda rather than providing objective and unbiased news and information.
* **Eliminating the "Firewall":** Namdar criticizes the "firewall" that is supposed to protect USAGM journalists from political interference, arguing that it has been used to shield "anti-American propaganda" and "politically biased viewpoints."
    * **Concern:** This could lead to greater political control over USAGM's content, potentially undermining its credibility and turning it into a mouthpiece for the Administration.
* **Consolidating and Reducing Services:** Namdar calls for consolidating and reducing redundant services across USAGM's networks, arguing that this would save money and improve efficiency.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a reduction in the diversity of voices and perspectives represented by USAGM, potentially limiting its reach and impact.
* **Shortwave Transmission Upgrades:** Namdar advocates for upgrading and expanding shortwave radio transmission capabilities, arguing that these are more reliable than web-based technologies in times of conflict or censorship.
    * **Concern:** This could be seen as a Cold War relic and a wasteful investment in outdated technology.
* **Personnel Changes:** Namdar calls for a more rigorous vetting process for USAGM personnel and for removing employees who are not aligned with the agency's mission.
    * **Concern:** This could lead to a purge of employees based on their political views, potentially creating a less diverse and less qualified workforce.

**Summary:**

Chapter 8 outlines a plan to reform USAGM, making it more accountable, efficient, and effective in promoting American values and countering adversarial propaganda. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a more politicized and less independent USAGM, with a greater emphasis on promoting American exceptionalism and a narrower range of voices and perspectives. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for USAGM to be used as a tool for propaganda and for the erosion of journalistic independence.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Propaganda and Censorship:** The chapter's emphasis on promoting "the truth about America" and eliminating the "firewall" suggests a willingness to use USAGM as a tool for government propaganda and to censor dissenting viewpoints.
* **Reduced Diversity of Voices:** The call for consolidating and reducing services could lead to a less diverse and less representative USAGM, potentially limiting its reach and impact.
* **Politicization of Personnel:** The call for more rigorous vetting and the removal of employees who are not aligned with the agency's mission could lead to a purge of employees based on their political views.
* **Wasteful Spending:** The advocacy for shortwave transmission upgrades could be seen as a wasteful investment in outdated technology.

This chapter highlights the tension between the desire to promote American values and the need to maintain journalistic integrity in government-funded international broadcasting. Namdar's proposals raise serious concerns about the potential for USAGM to be used as a tool for propaganda and for the erosion of journalistic independence under a future conservative administration.
