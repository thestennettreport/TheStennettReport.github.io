### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Media Agencies: U.S. Agency for Global Media](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_8.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_8_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** Mora Namdar, Former Vice President of Legal, Compliance, and Risk at the U.S. Agency for Global Media

Chapter 8 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the federal agency overseeing U.S. government-funded international broadcasting, including Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia. Authored by Mora Namdar, a former senior official at USAGM during the Trump administration, the chapter argues that the agency has strayed from its mission of promoting freedom and democracy and has become "mismanaged, disorganized, ineffective, and rife with waste and redundancy." She outlines a plan to reform USAGM, making it more accountable to a conservative president, efficient, and effective in countering adversarial propaganda and promoting American values, often conflating the two.

The chapter's significance lies in its call for a more ideologically driven and less journalistically independent USAGM, with a greater emphasis on promoting American exceptionalism and a narrower range of voices and perspectives. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for USAGM to be used as a tool for propaganda and for the erosion of journalistic integrity in government-funded international broadcasting.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **Promoting American Exceptionalism:** Namdar emphasizes the need for USAGM to promote "American values" and to present a positive image of the United States to the world, suggesting a shift away from objective journalism towards a more propagandistic approach.
* **Countering Adversarial Propaganda:** The chapter focuses on countering propaganda from adversaries like China and Russia, arguing that USAGM should be a "strategic asset" in the information war. This aligns with the broader conservative focus on countering foreign influence and promoting American interests abroad.
* **Eliminating "Bias" and "Waste":** Namdar criticizes USAGM for alleged "bias" and "waste," arguing that the agency has become too bureaucratic and inefficient. This reflects a broader conservative distrust of government agencies and a preference for smaller, more streamlined entities.
* **Strengthening Executive Control:** The chapter advocates for increasing the authority of the USAGM CEO and for reducing the independence of the agency's networks, suggesting a desire for greater political control over content and programming.
* **Traditional Media over Digital:** Namdar expresses skepticism towards digital media and advocates for investing in traditional broadcasting methods, such as shortwave radio, arguing that they are more effective in reaching audiences in countries with limited internet access.
