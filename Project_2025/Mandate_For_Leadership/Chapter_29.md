## Mandate for Leadership - Chapter 29 Breakdown

**[Chapter 29: Federal Election Commission](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_29.pdf)**

**Author:** Hans A. von Spakovsky, Senior Legal Fellow and Manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at The Heritage Foundation

**Introduction:**

This chapter focuses on the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the independent agency responsible for enforcing campaign finance laws. Von Spakovsky argues that while the President's direct authority over the FEC is limited, he can influence its direction through appointments and by directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce campaign finance laws in a manner consistent with the FEC's interpretations. He emphasizes the importance of protecting First Amendment rights and criticizes efforts to change the FEC's structure, arguing that the current bipartisan structure is essential to prevent the agency from being "weaponized."

**Key Points & Concerns for Democrats:**

* **Limited Presidential Authority:** Von Spakovsky acknowledges that the President's direct authority over the FEC is "extremely limited" due to its independent status.
    * **Concern:** This could be seen as an attempt to downplay the potential for a conservative President to influence the FEC's enforcement of campaign finance laws, potentially leading to a less rigorous enforcement of those laws.
* **Protecting First Amendment Rights:** Von Spakovsky emphasizes the importance of protecting First Amendment rights in the context of campaign finance regulation, arguing that the FEC and DOJ should not "infringe on protected First Amendment activity."
    * **Concern:** While protecting free speech is crucial, this could be used to justify a lax approach to enforcing campaign finance laws, potentially allowing wealthy donors and special interests to exert undue influence on elections.
* **DOJ Deference to FEC:** Von Spakovsky argues that the DOJ should defer to the FEC's interpretations of campaign finance laws when making prosecution decisions and should not prosecute individuals for conduct that the FEC has previously determined does not violate the law.
    * **Concern:** This could limit the DOJ's ability to prosecute campaign finance violations, particularly in cases where the FEC is deadlocked or has failed to act.
* **Defending the FEC in Litigation:** Von Spakovsky criticizes Democratic FEC commissioners for refusing to authorize the agency's general counsel to defend the FEC in lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs. He argues that the President should direct the Attorney General to defend the FEC in such cases.
    * **Concern:** This could be seen as an attempt to shield the FEC from accountability and could undermine the ability of citizens to challenge the agency's actions in court.
* **Maintaining the Bipartisan Structure:** Von Spakovsky strongly opposes efforts to change the FEC's structure, arguing that the current six-member, bipartisan commission is essential to prevent the agency from being "weaponized" for partisan purposes.
    * **Concern:** This could perpetuate the FEC's current gridlock and inaction, making it difficult to address campaign finance abuses. Democrats may favor a more independent and less partisan FEC structure that would be more effective in enforcing campaign finance laws.

**Summary:**

Chapter 29 outlines a conservative approach to the FEC that emphasizes protecting First Amendment rights, limiting the DOJ's role in prosecuting campaign finance violations, and maintaining the agency's current bipartisan structure. While some of these proposals, such as protecting free speech, may find bipartisan support, others, such as limiting the DOJ's role and maintaining the FEC's current structure, are likely to be more controversial and could raise concerns among Democrats about the potential for a weakening of campaign finance enforcement.

**Why This Chapter Might Scare Democrats:**

* **Weakening of Campaign Finance Laws:** The emphasis on protecting First Amendment rights and limiting the DOJ's role in prosecuting campaign finance violations could lead to a less rigorous enforcement of campaign finance laws, potentially allowing wealthy donors and special interests to exert undue influence on elections.
* **Perpetuating FEC Gridlock:** The support for maintaining the FEC's current bipartisan structure could perpetuate the agency's gridlock and inaction, making it difficult to address campaign finance abuses.
* **Shielding the FEC from Accountability:** The proposal for the DOJ to defend the FEC in litigation, even when the FEC itself has refused to do so, could shield the agency from accountability and could undermine the ability of citizens to challenge its actions in court.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, highlights the conservative agenda to limit the role of government in regulating political activity and to protect the interests of wealthy donors and special interests. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the integrity of American elections, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less fair and less democratic political system under a future conservative administration.
