### 1. CHAPTER OVERVIEW

**Title:** [Department of the Interior](../../documents/project_2025_chapters/chapter_16.pdf) <sup>[(TL;DR Version)](./chapter_16_tldr.md)</sup>

**Author:** William Perry Pendley, Former Acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management

Chapter 16 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" focuses on the Department of the Interior (DOI), the agency responsible for managing and protecting America's vast natural resources, including public lands, energy resources, and wildlife. Authored by William Perry Pendley, a controversial figure who served as Acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) under President Trump, the chapter argues that the Biden Administration has waged a "war" on the West by prioritizing environmental protection over economic development and energy production. Pendley outlines a plan to restore "American energy dominance" by unleashing fossil fuel production on public lands, rolling back environmental regulations, and empowering states and local communities to manage resources.

The chapter's significance lies in its aggressive push to prioritize resource extraction and economic development over environmental conservation on public lands. Pendley's recommendations, if implemented, could lead to a significant increase in drilling, mining, and logging on public lands, potentially resulting in widespread environmental damage, habitat destruction, and a loss of public access to these treasured spaces. This agenda raises serious concerns among Democrats and environmental advocates about the future of America's public lands and the potential for irreversible harm to our natural heritage.

### 2. KEY THEMES & FRAMEWORKS

* **"American Energy Dominance":**  Pendley echoes the "American energy dominance" theme prevalent throughout Project 2025, arguing that the U.S. should prioritize energy production, particularly fossil fuels, on public lands to achieve energy independence and economic growth.
* **Deregulation and State Control:** The chapter advocates for a significant rollback of environmental regulations and a transfer of control over public lands from the federal government to states and local communities. This reflects a broader conservative distrust of federal authority and a belief that states are better equipped to manage resources.
* **Economic Development over Conservation:** Pendley prioritizes economic development, particularly resource extraction, over environmental conservation, arguing that public lands should be used to generate revenue and create jobs.
* **Skepticism Towards Climate Change:** The chapter downplays the urgency of addressing climate change and criticizes environmental regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions as being harmful to the economy.
* **Property Rights and "Wise Use":** Pendley emphasizes the importance of property rights and the "wise use" of natural resources, suggesting that private interests should have greater access to public lands for development and resource extraction.

### 3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**3.1 Introduction: A "War on the West" <sup>(552)</sup>**

* Pendley argues that the Biden Administration is waging a "war on the West" by prioritizing environmental protection over economic development and energy production on public lands.
* He claims that these policies are harming rural communities, destroying jobs, and undermining national security.
* **Quote:** "The Biden Administration has declared war on the West, and the Department of the Interior is its primary weapon."

**3.2 The Solution: "Unleashing American Energy" <sup>(553)</sup>**

* Pendley calls for "unleashing American energy" by expanding oil and gas leasing and production on public lands and waters, arguing that this is essential for economic growth, job creation, and national security.
* He criticizes the Biden Administration for pausing new oil and gas leases and for promoting renewable energy sources, which he views as unreliable and inefficient.
* **Quote:** "We must unleash American energy and restore our energy independence. Public lands hold vast reserves of oil, natural gas, and coal, and we must develop these resources responsibly to create jobs and to power our economy."

**3.3 Rolling Back Regulations <sup>(555)</sup>**

* Pendley advocates for rolling back a wide range of environmental regulations that he believes are "burdensome" and "unnecessary," including those related to the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Clean Water Act.

### 10. SUMMARY & SIGNIFICANCE

Chapter 16 of "Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership" outlines a conservative vision for the DOI that prioritizes energy production, economic development, and a reduced role for the federal government in managing public lands and protecting the environment. The chapter's recommendations could lead to a significant increase in fossil fuel extraction on public lands, a weakening of environmental regulations, and a transfer of power from the federal government to states and local communities. These proposals raise serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for environmental degradation, climate change, and a loss of public lands and resources.

This chapter, along with the previous chapters, demonstrates a consistent pattern in "Project 2025": a desire to prioritize economic development and energy production over environmental protection and to reduce the role of the federal government in regulating industry and protecting public lands and resources. The proposals outlined in this chapter could have a significant impact on the health of our planet and the future of American public lands, raising serious concerns among Democrats about the potential for a less sustainable and less equitable future under a future conservative administration.
