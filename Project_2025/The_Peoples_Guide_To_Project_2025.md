title: The People's Guide to Project 2025 - A Quantified Look at the Human Cost of a Conservative Agenda
---

This analysis breaks down "[The People's Guide to Project 2025](../documents/peoples_guide_to_project_2025.pdf)," a report published by [Democracy Forward](democracyforward.org), to quantify the potential harms of Project 2025's proposals on ordinary Americans. The guide provides a stark reminder that behind the abstract policy recommendations lie real-world consequences that could devastate the lives of millions.

**Key Findings:**

* **4.3 Million Workers Losing Overtime Protections:** Project 2025's proposal to lower the overtime threshold would strip 4.3 million workers of their right to overtime pay, forcing them to work longer hours for less pay.
* **40 Million People Facing Reduced Food Assistance:**  The project's recommendations to restrict access to food assistance, including SNAP (food stamps), could leave 40 million people struggling to put food on the table.
* **220,000 American Jobs Lost:**  Project 2025's proposals to cut funding for economic development programs, such as the Economic Development Administration (EDA), could result in the loss of 220,000 jobs.
* **1 Million Children Losing Access to Head Start:**  The project's proposal to eliminate the Head Start early education program would deprive over 1 million children of access to quality early childhood education, setting them back in their development and potentially perpetuating a cycle of poverty.
* **33 Million Seniors at Risk:**  Project 2025's proposals to push people towards private Medicare plans, such as Medicare Advantage, could leave 33 million seniors enrolled in traditional Medicare at risk of higher costs, reduced benefits, and worse health outcomes.
* **368,000 Foster Children Facing Discrimination:**  The project's proposal to allow more discrimination against LGBTQ+ youth in adoption and foster care agencies could expose 368,000 children in foster care to increased discrimination, denying them loving homes and jeopardizing their well-being.
* **25 States and D.C. Students Denied Student Loans:**  Project 2025's proposal to deny student loans to students at schools that provide in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants would harm students in 25 states and Washington, D.C., limiting their access to higher education and perpetuating a cycle of poverty.

**Groups Disproportionately Harmed:**

* **Low-Income Families:**  Project 2025's proposals to cut social programs, restrict access to healthcare, and weaken worker protections would disproportionately harm low-income families, pushing them further into poverty and making it harder for them to make ends meet.
* **Minority Communities:**  The project's agenda on immigration, voting rights, and criminal justice would disproportionately harm minority communities, who are already facing systemic racism and discrimination.
* **Women:**  The project's attacks on reproductive rights and its failure to address issues like pay equity and affordable childcare would disproportionately harm women, undermining their economic security and bodily autonomy.
* **LGBTQIA+ Individuals:**  Project 2025's proposals to restrict transgender rights, allow discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, and censor information about LGBTQIA+ issues would create a hostile environment for LGBTQIA+ individuals, particularly youth, and could lead to increased discrimination, harassment, and violence.
* **Veterans:**  The project's plan to dismantle the VA and privatize veterans' healthcare would harm veterans, particularly those who rely on the VA for specialized care or who have disabilities.
* **Rural Communities:**  The project's proposals to cut funding for rural development programs, weaken environmental protections, and promote fossil fuel production could harm rural communities, which often rely on these programs and are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

**The People's Guide's Call to Action:**

The "People's Guide to Project 2025" concludes with a call to action, urging readers to:

* **Get Informed:**  Learn about the specific proposals in Project 2025 and their potential consequences.
* **Share the Information:**  Talk to your friends, family, and community about the dangers of this agenda.
* **Take Action:**  Contact your elected officials, support organizations fighting back, and get involved in the 2024 election.

**Conclusion:**

The "People's Guide to Project 2025" provides a stark reminder that behind the abstract policy recommendations of Project 2025 lie real-world consequences that could devastate the lives of millions of Americans. The guide's quantified impacts highlight the human cost of this conservative agenda, revealing its potential to exacerbate poverty, increase inequality, and harm the most vulnerable members of our society.

This analysis underscores the urgent need to resist Project 2025 and to advocate for policies that prioritize the needs of all Americans, not just those aligned with a conservative ideology. We must fight for a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for all.
